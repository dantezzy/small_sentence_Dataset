someone carries a passed out someone down a upstairs
her arms hug him around the neck and her head rests against shoulder
someone brings her into a bedroom and lays down
the teen sleepily
someone guides her raised knees down and covers her with quilt
heading out he pauses at the door and glances solemnly back her
his expression growing resigned he leaves and shuts the door in the morning someone transfers scrambled eggs from a pan onto a plate toast
he sets the meal on a table for someone balks
she pushes the away
as someone takes the plate from the table someone in
without meeting his gaze the teen takes a cola from the refrigerator sits at the table and sullenly
someone regards her with a smirk
someone tilts his sheepishly
someone brings her the untouched breakfast someone glares at him glances at the plate and leaves with an sneer
someone follows her outside and finds her on cellphone
seated at the edge of an inground pool littered leaves
someone steps away picks up a skimmer and scoops some of the out
clad in a bikini the teen ends call
someone wags bottom
pouting someone flips her father the bird and inside
someone gets in pool
treading water someone stares at father
she looks stricken
blinking back tears someone meets his gaze
surrounding by dead floating leaves the teen away
she sinks down beneath the water and holds her head in hands
large air bubbles escape her gaping mouth as her body shakes sobs
her features contort fiercely and she swims through water
someone walks alongside her as her emerges
she climbs out and buries her face in a towel
her father approaches with a frown
wheeling around someone finds him with his arms spread open her
she him
her father watches her go with a gaze
fully dressed and curled up on a sofa someone faces its back and rests her chin on her folded arms someone in
the girl thoughtfully

looking away someone shakes head
he springs to his feet paces
the betrayed halts
his back to someone turns
someones chest and
he registers a hint of nod
he has shrug
he has hands on hips
someone turns away and restlessly
his hands curl into fists release
facing someone he rubs his chin nose
he goes out onto the porch and steps into a pair of shoes
he hops and hobbles as he pulls them over his heels one at time
clambering down to driveway
someone breaks into run
the family man races out of a culdesac and reaches a narrow road
he follows it at a sprint his brow furrowed and his arms furiously
running at a stilted gait
he reaches a hairpin curve and follows it onto a street canopied with trees
it leads him to a neighborhood nestled by foothills
arriving at a twostory house he passes a little brown goat on his way up driveway
through a window in a cluttered kitchen we watch him arrive at a door where he lets in
he ventures further into his house
someone emerges on an landing
they someone
someone stares wideeyed someone
someone looks regretfully
someone heaves breath
someone fidgets with his ring
someone takes a seat nods
someone screws his jaw to one side and someone
as someone sinks down in a chair someones softened
he shrugs a helplessly
someone doubles over burying her face in her hands as her husband looks sympathetically
someone pulls a chair out from a nearby table and sits facing friends
he leans forward his elbows on knees
his gaze fixes on someone then morosely
someones eyes glisten and he gives a nod
he swallows hard and blinks tears
with a resigned smirk his gaze toggles between someone someone
leaves
as someone rocks herself her arms folded someone gazes remorsefully after friend
someone heads down the sundappled driveway past goat
someone catches up him
someone gives a small nod goes
someone heads back toward house
now on a bridge stretching over a sparkling stream someone weeps into hand
he wipes face
keeping his head down he wipes his eyes and continues across bridge
now he hikes wearily across a healthy lawn bordered by a wall
the stone one meets a second wall of painted cinder block thats stained along the top mold
someone arrives at the culdesac leading to driveway
he heads toward his home passing lush shrubs
someone turns he approaches the pool area where his daughters share a chair
a teen boy reclines in a chair them
someone extends a hand someone bounds up and it
he throws an arm around someone in a hug
someone someone
someone eyes the teen boy with a frown
someone grins shrugs
now a mans aging hands hold a document headed advance healthcare directive the reader a man with a grey buzz scowls
someone tosses it bitterly
someone subdues glare
someones quivers
getting to his feet the older man steps away from the table in his beige knee socks sandals
wearing a white tee tucked into his khaki shorts he keeps his back to someone someone and someone who watch him halt on grass
someones mouth twists in a repressed sob and he rubs his lips back into a line
his chest rises and falls and he bows head
creasing his lips he lifts his gaze
later inside someone gently leads a silverhaired woman by hand
she wears a vacant confused expression as he takes her down hallway
to a living room where the three wait
someone remains seated at the far end of room
someone and someone respectfully get to feet
he kisses cheek
now standing someone smiles waves

someone and someone duck down in their seats and discreetly cover their faces a pickup truck passes by someone hunches down well
all straighten
working his jaw someone briefly returns his vulnerable gaze to the strangers house then droops his forward
seen from distance
his cars break lights blink on and he away
the sedan follows the winding residential downhill
traveling through another neighborhood the car passes a large beautifully landscaped house on corner
the car up
a real estate sign stands posted outside the homes fence of rails
the real estate sign lists the name someone speer and shows a happy photo of a beadyeyed man with a grin
at home trophies medals and beaded lace fill a set shelves
a central photo shows a smiling someone wearing a race number on shirt
someone uses phone
sitting in a day bed with a bottle of jameson irish whisky at his side someone takes a steadying breath and ends call
as he turns off a lamp on a stand the scene cuts black
now clouds drift fast across the sky as dawn breaks at a sped pace
two mountains frame a distant view of fast motion traffic on highway
just off a coast dotted highrises
teams of rowers paddle canoes along the rippling water
under a now bright sky light traffic dots a road
in the city an american flag and a hawaiian state flag hang posted on either side of a entrance
in the hospital a pair of windowed doors show someone arriving with his daughters in tow he opens one door them
they lead the way into ward
his daughters gaze after him as he enters someones alone
someone shuts the door behind him then draws a curtain covering the windows to the floor
he faces wife
he glares down at his comatose wife and circles bed
his wife lies slackjawed motionless
leaning close someone holds an stare
he straightens picking up a teddy bear from bed
someone starts to gesture with it then hurls it across room
catching his breath he smooths his graying hair and away
someone draws himself up and leaves room
a regal chipped frame displays a photo of a little girl with hair
on a windowsill a varsity letter p stands propped against diploma
another photo shows a radiantly someone
someone ambles into the hospital room her eyes fixed on mother
reaching the foot of the bed she glances at someone then takes another closer
her comatose mothers chest rises and falls under her tube

someone leads a taller girl into room
someone gives a wave
someone glances around then joins her friend at bedside
nods
exits
someone eyes sister
someone points to someone who guiltily averts gaze
someone grabs his cellphone from counter
then leans heavily
the display indicates an incoming call from gold coast estate
someone shows the cellphone to someone and her widen
she grabs it from him and crosses room
she up
nodding softly someone shifts his gaze
now over a dozen cars fill the driveway
inside using chopsticks people fill their plates with crabs sushi
someone and someone peruse the buffet table while other guests convene in the room
a woman with short grey hair chats with friends
in the kitchen someone gazes off sullenly he takes a sip scotch
a teenage boy enters the room and approaches him behind
he takes another sip of drink
someone shakes his head struggling to retain composure
he chuckles to himself but quickly succumbs sobs
the others look mournfully
he wipes nose
that evening he crosses driveway
he waves to the last departing car as he watches it off
a breeze blows through the bushes flanking the end of driveway
heading back for the house someone shuffles across lawn
he drops to his hands and knees hanging his head low to ground
sitting back on his ankles the weary husband rests his hands on his thighs and gazes pensively
now he sits in his office over a load paperwork
they notice the recorder in hand
someone lowers her gaze and bites her lip
now as a hawaiian airlines jet takes off the image dissolves to the map of hawaii with a dashed line leading from oahu kauai
on the flight someone chats someone
someone listens music
across the aisle someone stares at someones eye
he turns his wry gaze away and awkwardly finds himself face to face with the large goateed passenger to left
someone abruptly faces forward later outside airport
a friendlyfaced guy comes over
now a hula girl doll bobbles on the dashboard of a vehicle
the white opentop jeep cruises down a road
the kids ride in back with the wind in their hair someone and his cousin sit front
the white jeep makes a left turn off the coastal highway onto a street
then heads down a dirt road bordered by a fence
a distant mountain range spans horizon
later someone chains a metal gate to a wooden post and returns to the jeep beyond which a herd of cows grazes in field
a few cows stand in way
later the jeep travels a winding dirt path wide enough for only vehicle
our view pulls back to encompass the landscape which includes lush trees and hills
heading uphill the jeep jostles passengers
it reaches the summit of the treelined road and rolls to stop
someone out
the others climb out well
someone shuts his door
as the group continues up the dirt road our view turns to them
someone runs out on a grassy ridge past the corner of an old foundation
they all stop on the overlook
below lies a majestic cove of wild land
the tide rolls in gently on the beach
someone glances at someone with a faint smile sighs
hovering over the group our view turns away from the grassy ridge for a final glimpse of the vast cove and its surroundings
now we pull back from a faux italian statue of neptune towering over the center of a fountain with scalloped ridges evocative of an shell
the jeep drives by following a bend in road
we drive past a sign for sandpiper village another for paniolo then a golf course abutting a community
riding in the passenger seat someone holds his forehead as he absently gazes out window
the jeep arrives at a hotel driving past a fountain near entrance
later at the front desk someone folds up wallet
a clerk looks up the name on computer
now at the beach he ambles over to a blanket where alexandra suns her back and someone lies with her head on shoulder
her bikini top filled with lumps sand
someone wanders over to the water to shake out sand
someone reaches behind her back and fastens her own top as her father takes seat
later strolling the beach someone shows someone a photo of someone speer from a real ad
someone and someone trail behind someone and someone as they make their way down the sand
we draw back to take in a wide stretch of the shoreline and the misty mountain beyond
a wide lowlimbed tree shades view
the sun sets behind the watery horizon as the foursome continues along the shore toward a resort
the low waves lapping gently at ankles
now an adults only menu pops up on a screen
someone mans the remote control as her family finishes dinner in their suite
someone snatches remote
flailing her arms someone prances out of room
the frustrated father glances aside then meets someones gaze
someone steps out from a bathroom and shuts off light
he plops down on his unmade bed and sits alone in dark
now someone opens a door and steps into the suites dark room
shuffling through the shadows he pauses by a sofa and juts his forward
lying under a blanket on a fold out bed someone rolls his head to look up someone
someone stares at him then shifts his frustrated gaze nods
he switches on a lamp near pillow
the teen shuts his eyes frowning against light
someone shakes head
he shuffles around the fold out bed shrugs and takes seat
someone thoughtfully
someone lifts chin
someone settles into pillows
someone gives a thoughtful nod and regards teen
someone offers a smile
someone glances down ponderously nods again and trains a warm gaze on boy
someone takes a breath
someone hunkers down and pulls his blanket up to chin
the lamp blinks off and the scene cuts black
now on a misty morning the waves crawl up on the sandy beach beneath an sky
in a faded black tshirt someone jogs along the shoreline he moves with a rhythmic purposeful gait glancing occasionally over the water
some distance ahead another approaches
someone dismissively
as the lanky figure draws near we recognize face
the real estate agent gives a sportsmanlike wave as passes
someone returns the gesture then halts and stares back him
his brow knits and he takes off someone
he quickens his pace struggling to catch up to his lover
but someones longlegged stride keeps him several ahead
someone works his way up to a sprint staring at someone through eyes
the real estate agent turns and trots up the beach toward a row hedges
someone pauses watching him run toward a gatelike gap in greenery
as someone passes out of sight the wronged husband dashes toward the line
glancing over his shoulder he slows then quickens his pace to a scramble
he arrives at the hedge and ducks behind it near gap
seen from inside the gap shows someone darting across to take cover behind the hedge
he peeks up over the top and finds someone steps
to a onestory home with a broad roof a fulllength porch and a lawn
someone stares only the top half of his visible
as someone kicks off his running shoes and inside
staying put someone narrows eyes
someone comes back out guzzling water from bottle
he descends halfway down the porch steps then leans back against a pillar
a pretty woman with strawberry blond hair comes out trailed by boys
they bring plates and cups to a table on lawn
someones arched eyebrows knit and his narrow
he slowly sinks out view
now sitting on a blanket on the beach someone leans back on hands
beside him someone lies down and chats with a sid
several yards ahead someones form bobs in and out of view as she plays in ocean
as someone watches her he shoots frequent glances over his shoulder toward rental
behind him the strawberry blond emerges with her boys
someone notices as the boys race to water
the woman slows to a walk wearing a sun hat and a longsleeved shirt of blue
she drops a large fashionable tote in the sand walks to the waters edge and cups her hands around mouth
the boys splash each rambunctiously
someone leans someone
someone rolls over and up
she glances toward someone then gazes after her curiously
someone meanders down to the waters edge and stops a few feet from woman
in her sweater and black bikini bottoms she watches her boys play
the woman goodnaturedly
someone bites back a comment and faces water
the woman offers a sincere frown
someone musters smile
the mother faces water
watching her someone adopts a demeanor
someone twitches himself out of a hold
someone marches from water
as someone joins someone mrs someones smile fades and she watches him with a brow
now shafts of sunlight beam through gaps in the clouds lighting up patches of ocean
in a forest a rusted metal bridge spans a brook
raindrops plop into the placid water dotting it with percolations
now someone his daughters and someone walk toward an inviting ragtag bungalow with a porch and yard
a sign out front reads tahiti nui restaurant lounge
someone leads the way up to the porch then through doorway
the family pauses near the threshold taking in the thriving casual spot
on a small stage three male singers perform on stools as they strum a guitar a ukulele and bass
scanning the restaurant someone spots a man with grey shoulderlength hair at bar
someone sidles down the narrow gap between the bar and a wall then rounds a corner to the other side and someone
someone confusedly
someone lowers his thunderstruck gaze then faces stage
someone adopts a nonchalant air someones easygoing fades
someone regards his cousin with a flinty stare looking away he puts on smile
with a worried frown someone bridles and blinks at cousin
someone up
the cousins hug and someone sends someone off with an affectionate rub of head
the shell shocked man lumbers across the area
reaching his table he collapses into a chair and leans heavily
he stares off with eyes
someone lifts his brow and blinks back tears
taking a breath he shakes himself out of thoughts
someone who is seated between his daughters faces us as though were in position
someone bobs to music
someone looks us
someones looking at us as he replies his gaze wilts he glances at the band then rubs face
his weary profile shows against the backdrop of the lively performers he idly surveys the bar then peers over shoulder
giving us a view of his distracted face on
now under a dusky sky someone his daughters and someone walk alongside a fence that borders a field
mountains loom in the distance someone and someone walk a few ahead
someone bites lip
at night someone someone
he leaves someone
someone and someone make their way across the road
walking side by side they advance on the large cottage occupied by speers
moving around the house they find mrs speer coming out onto the porch
someones turns

someone out
someones falters
someone inside
someone conjures his grin
his vanishes
someone responds with a stare
behind someone indoors someone drinks

someone draws his dumbfounded mouth shut nods
someones gaze melancholy
someone looks shamefully
someone responds with a bitter sneer and shakes head
someone lowers his remorseful gaze and his pucker
bristles
his jaw tightens and he holds someone in a weary stare
he exits cottage
as she leans in to hug him someone tilts his head and gives her a full kiss on the instead
with an intense stare he heads off leaving confused
now on the flight back someone stares pensively
sitting behind him someone scoots forward in her seat and claps a hand on shoulder
someone nods faintly her father turns away and hangs head
in the window seat beside her big sister someone with
a pillow between her head and wall
as she stirs a little getting comfortable the image dissolves to a corridor in hospital
someone his daughters and someone trudge in from around corner
as the girls approach someones bed someone wraps her arm around her sisters shoulders they gaze at their mother
she lies with each hand curled around a rolled up towel and her mouth slack
now a kindfaced woman someone
someone dr someone and someone look on from in front of bed
the grief counselors lips form a line
someones eyes fill with tears and she turns to father
seeing his woeful look she lowers gaze
the kindfaced counselor strokes arm
her lips trembling the girl turns back to her
as the counselor continues speaking someones face crumples anguish
the bereaved little girl watches the woman leave with someone
then embraces her father burying her face in chest
he kisses the top of head
he caresses her hair then tilts her face up to meet gaze
someone gently slides her hands down her ponytail
cradling head
someone lifts his eyes to his daughter
someone pushes out a breath and shifts her attention to mother
later our view shifts from bed
to someone doing paperwork and someone and someone books
from the corridor someone peers into the room then enters with his wife and son him
someone sets aside work
he and someone hug someone and his mother
as someone leads her uncle and grandmother to someones bedside someone shifts his gaze someone

someone shrugs his lips then joins his family at bedside
someone gestures to someone and someone and they follow him into corridor
he pulls the closed
opening the door a crack someone peeks back into room
someone and someone move in close to him and they all spy on standing at his bedside
the griefstricken man gives a shrug
then leans over someone and strokes hair
the three outside sympathetically
resting his hand on his daughters head someone bends down and gives her a light kiss on cheek
the onlookers watch him whisper i you
he continues caressing his hair
tightening his lips defeatedly he withdraws hand
he lifts his gaze from his dying daughter and glances unfocused toward doorway
in the morning sunlight peeks through a blanket clouds
and shines down on a lush ridge
at home someone sleeps with his face resting on his desk
one of his fingers twitches and awakes
with a frown he up
blinking groggily he looks at his watch then leans forward on his elbows and shifts his eyes
he pushes his chair back from the desk rises
he exits past the portraits of his great grandparents
the image dissolves to a sprawling property
someone  s car glides toward a fork in a driveway
to one side lies a large ranch style house and a court
on the other grazing ducks scatter as someone pulls over onto a wellmanicured lawn parks
now he enters the large house allowing sunlight to filter through the screen door into the unlit room
as he pushes open the curtains on the windows
more daylight washes over a wall decorated with photos
he strolls it
then stops and gazes at the black and white images of ancestors
a mustached man gives a serious look another shows a woman
in a third photo four men in suits stand on a buildings steps
behind the glass of a large frame wooden block letters spell out kikila above an antique photo of a man with a mutton chop beard a plaque beside it reads cecil kikila king the namesake of this beautiful place he was a prominent attorney banker and socialite in hawaii
someone eyes more photos of family members throughout the years two men and two women in 1920s garb
leaving the photos someone steps out onto lawn
a group of about 40 suddenly fades view
some at picnic tables others standing chatting
one of the king cousins breaks off from the socializing to place a folded slip of paper in a large bowl
then sets down pen
laughs
wink smokes cigar
someone talks someone
dogs laze about in the grass at their feet
two more cousins drop off folded slips of paper into the bowl
now someone stares off with doleful eyes as he sits at table
someone unfolds a ballot and it
he hands paperwork
he offers pen
frowning someone takes it then flips through paperwork
someone and someone watch with smiles
someone thoughtfully hovers his pen over the blank line
he gazes at documents
someone furrows his eyebrows
someone glances at his two cousins then looks back at the contract and shakes head
someone and someone give him looks
someone glances at someone then shakes his head with a smile
tossing the documents aside he gives his cousins a look
someone lifts his brow and shares a thoughtful glance someone
the longhaired heavyset cousin smirks disapprovingly someone
he rubs his nose stands
the crowd over
he slaps shoulder
rising from his chair someone faces the group and gives them nod
they all watch expectantly
the scene in front of him fades to someones hospital room where our view edges closer to the back of head
as he watches family
now we travel up the bed quilt to hands
still curled loosely around the rolls
just above the neckline of her gown
a gauze dressing covers the stoma in trachea
its center dampened with a circle
her mouth hangs open her lips dry and parched
while her head lies tilted to side
on a couch someone asleep
someone sits lazily in a chair with one leg crooked upward as he somberly homework
slouched in another seat someone stares at her mother
our view drifts closer to her plaintive face as she blinks tears from eyes
as the door opens someone peers over her shoulder and sees a entering

someone stares with eyes
lowering the flowers someone speer glances between him someone
the teen shoots her father a look

and he sadly
someone glances uncertainly at wife
shifting her tearful eyes to someone someone steps to side
while someone watches from the foot of bed
someones face contorts in anguish as she gazes at the woman
she stares down at someones frozen expression
someone empathetically
someone gently takes her arm guides her to the door then stops and meets gaze
with a nod someone opens the door her
someone shuts it sighs
he turns his back to the door and stares across the room at someone in bed
remaining fixed on her someone draws and expels a breath
then ambles across the room and stands at bedside
the middleaged mans weary gaze grows affectionate as he reaches out her
looking over her frail form he softly
his fingers caress the pale womans hair just above forehead
with a fond look in eyes
smiles
he bends down and leans over her his fingers lingering on brow
he gives her a long gentle kiss on the lips remains
hovering just inches her
a tear rolls down nose
in a waiting area someone sits beside her father with tears in eyes
our view drifts to someones weary face as he stares across room
the door to someones opens
someone steps out her eyes puffy red
someone crosses the hallway toward family
someone rises from his chair and her
someone hugs father
resting her chin on his shoulder she upward
he kisses her temple then stands aside as she crosses someone
she gives her shaggyhaired friend hug
peering over his shoulder with her arm wrapped around neck
someone faces her sister
gazing up from her chair someone purses lips
someone offers her hands then guides her sister up from seat
she wraps her arm around the girl and they head together
someone and someone watch someone lead someone across hallway
someone lead someone into room
now a puffy cumulus cloud dominates the lower half of a view
its vapor edge forms fanciful bulges and dips across the blueness green vegetation blankets a range
on the yet unsold land the overlook offers a majestic view of the cove and the meadows and wild groves inland it
beyond a line of breaking waves vibrant shades of ocean blue extend to the horizon meeting powder sky
the blossoms of a plumeria flutter in a breeze their petals in shades of yellow pink
now sitting aboard an outrigger canoe someone nods and accepts container
she wears a pink and white lei around neck
someone watches his daughter from across the boat wearing a lei of colors

sitting in the middle of boat
someone watches her sister pour the scoop of ashes into water
someone hands the container her
they younger girl tearfully takes hold of the scoop handle but lets go of it and passes the canister on someone
the middleaged widower gazes at the dust
a skyward view from the ashes shows a breeze blowing through his hair
the girls watch as he holds the container over the side of boat
and pours the rest of someones ashes into sea
he taps the container against the side of the canoe to empty completely
someone watches the ashes mix with the water then glances at daughters
he takes off his lei and sets it on water
someone and someone do same
they watch their leis floating beside the boat bobbing on surface
seen from underwater the leis show in silhouette against the sunlight
they take on amoebalike shapes as they float beside canoe
someone lies on the couch under blanket
beyond the couch someone steps out from an arched doorway with two bowls in shorts and a hawaiian shirt someone joins someone and hands her one of bowls
someone sits on the couch and rests his feet on ottoman
as they eat their ice cream someone enters the distant dining room and digs through a bag on table
someone adjusts the end of someones blanket and covers legs
someone notices them from the dining room and strides observantly through archway
arms folded she halts behind the ice cream pair
someone drops her arms to her sides then steps around the couch and takes seat
beside her father forcing him more into the middle as she takes a corner of blanket
