he chalks lines through more
using chalks and a ruler
someone creates a design on the dark wall
he carefully rules lines and shades in areas of design
he draws in his sketchbook looking at the city skyline from rooftop
at night the skyline shimmers lights
nighttime traffic is a blur of speeded light
someone copies a city design onto the bedroom drawing nighttime traffic continues to blur through the city at speed
someone stands back and appraises the skyline
which is his artwork
someones being fitted for a dress
the chiffon veil is lowered over face
someone travels on bus
as someone sits gloomily on bus
someone smiles under veil
its lifted from face
and she kisses her husband
someone stares blankly on bus

someone wearing his suit reaches pavement level on escalator
he stares expressionlessly out across a park
he sits on his bench
he up
someones sitting on a bench a short away
wearing a dark skirt and raincoat
she strolls down him
they sit awkwardly side side
becoming serious he stares her
she smiles and away
hurt he looks away her
she selfconsciously brushes her hair away from face
they sit together looking out at city
she places her hand his
with a expression
he looks down at her ring

someone walks on a tiled floor through a large airy old building
someone takes a seat on a balustraded area
a young woman is on a sofa waiting
she has long hair
they notice other
they dont acknowledge another
someone walks off she smiles herself
someone stares her
she looks right at the camera with a twinkle in eye
day 500 becomes 1
the sun shines on the line city
blossoms bloom on the tree and birds fly in sky
two little birds hop on the ground towards another
someone the enforcer down and punches him in the face sending him crashing into water
as someones mother and father help the boys to their feet a pipe smoking man steps out he wears a top hat sunglasses
as someone approaches the pipe smoking man stops him with the butt of cane
he grabs the cane revealing its handle as a secret pistol aimed at chest
someone returns to family
grinning someone pokes his tongue between teeth
smoke plumes from the chimney of a cabin
inside writing in journal
someone peeks down from a loft glimpsing his parents asleep bed
his candle out
watching the front door open he back
as the door wider
someones shadow spreads across wall
someone down
as someone heads inside the shadow leaves wall
lying on the floor someone reaches for the edge of rug
he pulls back the rug and peeks through a hole in the floorboards for a partial view of the below
he watches someone kneel at his bedside
her open hand hangs off the edge of the bed her wrist exposed to intruder
someone looks at his mothers face
on returning his attention to her bedside he finds someone gaze him
her eyes roll back the veins of her forearm show through her skin
the priest heads off and someone follows leaving his wife alone bed
someone climbs down from loft

gazing thoughtfully someone sips drink
now on the dock someone hurries after couple
in a boat someone hides underneath dock
someone spies on the couple as they off
someone leans against a pole watching his superior set on a rowboat with two others a sign above a warehouse store reads j shipping
as someone heads inside someone climbs up a ladder to dock
he reaches into his jacket pocket and takes out pistol
as someone walks unsuspectingly someone takes aim at back
a puff of smoke rises from the gun
flees
someone marches him
someone hides in a shed but cant lock door
he tears open a packet of gunpowder and dumps it down his barrel
he readies hammer
as he loads a bullet a shove of the door him
the bullet rolls near the body of a woman
someone kicks open the door and someone fires the retrieved bullet at pointblank range the murderer falls to his back his top hat landing several feet across dock
catching his breath someone lowers pistol
he looks at someone the bullet now lodged in the dead mans eye
leaving he steps over the body and ambles around a corner of dock
someone glances back at someone who remains flat on back
he marches on across the dock through a fog
turning to the river he chucks his pistol into water
he lingers for a moment then on
glancing back down the dock he notices someone body missing
as he turns someone him
as the vampire bares his sharp fangs someone falls to his back someone lifts the young man overhead then slams his face through the dock he rips open someones shirt scratching chest
someone stands them
he grabs someone by the hair and him
the vampire crashes through the dock then gets thrown up along the warehouse shattering the wall as he ascends towards a huge full moon above the vampire disappears amid the falling shards of wood someone reaches someone
now in bed someone awake
daylight shines in through window
the weary young man feels his brow
water drips into various pots surrounding bed
sitting up he notices a bandage on his forearm and another on bicep
as he gazes at a wall portraits of a man and woman come focus
getting out of bed someone steps in one of the pots water
the young man rises from the bed and braces himself on mantle
weakly clutching his bruised side he crosses to a desk where he finds journal
he opens it then turns his attention to window
someone steps out into a hall and peers towards doorway
he heads up a staircase stopping after only a few steps to peek at an floor
hearing the sounds someone hurries back down the steps and presses his ear to door
he grabs a threefoot candlestick gathers himself then barges into the room
he finds a naked woman straddling someone in bathtub

a rifle
someone notices an outside
now he carries the ax over his shoulder as someone leads him through woods
wearing his sunglasses someones new mentor stops at a tree and gazes up the trunk
the young mans darkens
someone plants his feet staring at the trunk
his powerful swing cuts only a few in
he tries again but only chips trunk
twisting his whole body someone slices through the massive trunk woodchips fly from the cut and the tree topples to ground
as someone steps away someone thoughtfully
now light pours into a dark room as someone opens door
someone enters with ax
someone kicks the door shut rendering the room black
in the light of the now open door someone holds the ax while someone crawls toward the door his face beaten bloody
he pauses at threshold
he slams the door now someone nimbly twirls the ax practicing later someone swings the ax in swirling patterns around his tall lean frame gaining speed with proficiency he finishes with a mighty swing
now balanced on logs someone spars with an unarmed someone the prot  g  falls then springs to his feet later someone throws the ax someone catches it and splits a tree trunk someone writes in journal
at forge

he gives someone a smile
douglas scrutinizes the man
douglas faces him and his condescending fades
someone stares admiringly at someone as arrives
it bears a wax seal someone watches someone as he takes it behind the counter and rips it open small tidy handwriting fills half the page
someone hands her list to him with a friendly smirk dusk
as joshua leaves someone locks up then throws down his apron and hurries to action in his room he slaps down the letter dons an overcoat and gets ax
he unsheathes the dagger
at night we swoop low over the streets of springfield passing smoking chimneys as lightning flashes in the distance at the end of the street someone approaches a pharmacy in his long coat and hat
clutching the letter he peers in through window
the young man steps inside and lets the door swing shut him
he crosses the floor between two service counters quickening his pace as he nears back
in the pharmacy workroom a bespectacled man with sizable sideburns grinds a pestle in mortar
as he turns someone narrows his eyes stibble rests the pestle against the mortars rim as someone reaches in his coat stibble bears his fangs someone charges but the vampire powder
the dust clears revealing stibbles distorted monstrous features he knocks someone back then activates a trapdoor the vampire hunter plunges through and a rope snare catches him around ankle
nearby a naked man hanging upside down shows no sign of life we pull back to find someone in a room full of victims each suspended upside down the young hunter futile reaches for floor
beside him blood streams from a dying man into bowls set on floor
his ax lies them
arriving stibble kicks it away and him
he binds wrists
as the trapped hunter looks on the vampire opens a gleaming straight razor turns it over and touches the blade someone resumes his struggle to free himself as stibble sharpens the blade against the porcelain bowls ornate rim crouching low the vampire slips the bowl beneath hunter
someones dagger slips from his belt he catches it in his feet then slashes the throat
contracting his abdomen he curls upward and cuts through the snare rope someone falls to the floor frees his wrists and retrieves his ax as stibble charges he delivers a mighty blow
spraying blood soaks half his face using his hand someone wipes it away with a expression
later in the misty woods the vampire hunter digs grave
silhouetted against the moonlit mist someone puts on his hat
daytime in the general store someone uses a hand mirror as he applies sap to a swollen bruise on cheek
someone bursts energetically
he tosses someone parcel
someone pulls out pants
wearing a tuxedo with his stovepipe hat someone follows someone into mansion
someone away
from across the room someone catches his gaze as she ignores her chattering fianc e
someone joins couple
facing someone someone discreetly jerks his aside
she turns and scans room
beyond a circle of waltzing couples someone sits snacking nuts
as someone approaches he puts the remainder back in a bowl and dusts his hands off on pants
she looks down at him with a sweet smile
douglas notices her absence then spots her dancing someone
someone twirls her now at the store someone drops a letter him
in a vault someone sneaks up on a banker as he swings his ax the man turns and vanishes he briefly reappears baring his fangs someone reaches in his pocket and throws a handful of grain it falls to floor
he notices a door sliding open and throws handful
it hits an invisible mass the banker reappears just long enough to strike midsection
the hunter reaches in his pocket but finds no grain
in the dusty air he spies a shape approaching and throws his ax dodging it the charging vampire reappears someone sidesteps and decapitates him on a shelf
later the banker  s head lies upside down in grave
someone buries him amid several other graves in a smithy a powerfully build vampire blocks someones attack and bends him back over the forge the hunter stomps on a bellows and the blazing flame sends the vampire reeling back someone grabs him and thrusts his head into the fire repeatedly stomping on the bellows now on a picnic with someone someone dozes off spilling a cup tea
she nods someone takes her cup and sets it down then takes her hands his
he leans forward staring up at earnestly
someone turns her head away and presses her lips together suppressing smile
she playfully
with a modest smirk he gives a wave
that night as someone trots down a sidewalk someone follows clapping the picnic basket lid like a mouth
the reach a house gate and face each other sharing a smile
beaming hopefully someone steps closer and rises up on her toes leaning her face his
taller
someone takes a deep breath and makes no move to her
someone removes his hat sets it on the ground and steps up it
as she leans in he turns his cheek to lips
nods
taking a deep breath she steps down and picks up hat
she manages a bright smile and heads for house
gazing after her trips
from across the street a oneeyed someone leers at the scene
stepping forward he sees someone pause at the door to watch her go
now in the deep south a veiled woman rides a horse up a dirt path to a plantation house trees dripping with spanish moss provide a overhead
later she strides into a dining room where someone sits alone at table
she slaps a newspaper down before him sits
someone ignores it she slides the paper closer and turns
boasting strawberry blonde tresses and sultry features someone puffs pipe
frowning someone takes up the paper and reads headline
six headless bodies found near springfield someone stibble jr among dead
smirking someone lifts brow
now in the general store someone reads a book an africanamerican man steps inside takes off his hat and shuts door
someone eyes the visitor from desk
noticing a scar on the visitors cheek remembers
he hops over the counter and him
he takes off apron
someone ducks a swipe from the first man then someone strikes again now someone and someone sit in a jail cell someone paces outside bars
she reaches through the bars and turns head
daytime on a street corner someone addresses a crowd from soapbox
someone rides up in carriage
someone steps down from his soapbox and the crowd gathers him
he walks with an older man sunglasses
someone opens a carriage door and the man hands him card

someone away
he flees among his frightened horses an aerial view shows the herd crossing a riverside field as the vampire runs up ahead someone mounts one of horses
someone leaps forward between two horses grabs onto their necks and hangs them

the vampire tackles him and bares fangs
someone blocks him with the shaft of his ax they both see a horse charging straight them
the stallion knocks someone off someone sending him tumbling across the dirt the vampire rises to his feet he boldly grabs the front leg of an oncoming horse flipping the steed on its back using the horse like a track and field hammer he hurls it at his enemy knocking him to the ground amid the chaos of the stampede the horse rises with someone on back
the vampire hunter rides on leaning down for his ax as he passes up ahead someone bounds off the back of two horses and mounts a third someone nears his target holding his ax at the ready someone glances back over shoulder
he ducks the swing of the ax someone leans back as someone throws a roundhouse kick the vampire grabs the ax and flips someone on to the back of another horse as someone mounts the horse he sees someone run off across the backs of the herd someone attempts to stand on his back
he rises to his feet then runs after the vampire landing on a new horses back with every daring step through a veil of wafting dust we glimpse someone as he looks back grins

someone brings down his ax now at night a man forces a young woman through a alley
he slams her against a brick wall clutching throat
behind the man someone steps out from a shadowy recess across alley
with a calm deliberate gaze he nears the rapists exposed neck and takes bite
as the vampire brings his flailing victim down the young woman escapes down alley
someone steps out from around a corner and catches his bloodsucking mentor in act
someone meets gaze
he rises from his victim and holds up hands
cautiously he someone
someone throws his ax but someone it
someone kicks him down and swing but someone grabs the ax more
in a flashback on a treelined road someone hops out of his carriage and takes a look at wheel
as he kisses a woman leaning out of the window he notices a team of approaching
the dark haired woman sits back and someone hands her gun
he draws dagger
as someone approaches the group a rider hops down from his horse and disappears as the others look on the unshaven man holds his ground awaiting the attack
the vampire appears and someone dodges a swipe he ducks another then slashes his attackers masked mouth creating a spectacular spray gore
a mildly frustrated someone dismounts someone tries to stab his attacker but the vampire clutches his wrist he drops his dagger catches it with his free hand then slashes and leg sweeps his foe he slashes a second attackers kicking leg then drives his blade through the vampires palm and flips him onto back

as someone crosses to the dark haired woman a dazed someone rises to his feet but struggles to maintain his balance he watches someone wrap his arms her
sinking his teeth into her neck he spins her around lifting her off feet
someones eyes back
he watches the attack in a stupor his jaw slack
someone slows his spin to a stop then lets his victim sink to ground
trembling face down someone watches his love
with his boot someone rolls her on back
someone shakes head
baring his newfound fangs someone grabs his dagger and charges the vampire he goes to strike but his arm stops midstab with both hands he swipes at someone and attempts to stab him in the heart but an unseen force holds the back
someone lowers his gaze
someone leaves him alone
someone glances back at the riders then goes to his side
he gently turns her face to his own and kisses her on lips
back in present
beside someone someone rises to feet
the seated vampire meets gaze
as someone walks away a flash of lightning brightens the walls
now through a downpour the tall young man crosses street
wearing his top hat overcoat
he steps onto a curb and crosses a sidewalk heading for the store
as he unlocks the front door someone approaches him behind
as someone looks up from the door a hooded nears
pulling his ax from his jacket he turns strike
someone reaches into jacket

at a dock someone runs his gloved hand over the top of a casket
someone stands nearby as do several vampires
someone opens the casket revealing inside
he removes a red rose petal from one of the slain vampires eyes then notices something in hand
someone turns someone hand palm up and pries his fingers from someones watch
he slams the lid
the vampires wait as their brooding leader steps away from casket
someone stops and thoughtfully
he turns back and ambles over someone
now a carriage arrives at building
someone rides inside wearing veil
someone leaves someone with book
as he heads off someone reads from the book leaning against wall
one of the two men steps down beside someone then him
now someone finds someone in study
someone takes a seat and hands someone book
he finds a flowery invitation inside someone quickly gathers his jacket hat
now on boat
they stand on the deck of their humble vessel as it approaches a fleet of steampowered riverboats crowding a bustling harbor pillars of black smoke plume skyward miles
orleans
now spanish moss hangs low from the branches of surrounding trees as someone and someone ride a modest horse drawn carriage up a path
on either side wooden shacks show no sign inhabitance
a pot hangs over a stack firewood
from inside a shack a mochaskinned woman with a headkerchief wields a rifle as she peers out through a gap in the wood wall
at night the carriage approaches the house
the moonlit spanish moss over their head sways eerily in breeze
now a window reflects burning candles and frames someone and someone as they walk up to house
peering in they find white people waltzing with slaves at ball
among them someone recoils from someone as she holds tight
someone draws ax
he hurries inside
someone lunges at someone baring fangs
as someone stares the vampires attack the slaves someone wrenches free but the shy woman succumbs to a vicious bite someone pleasurably
as someone fight off the attacker slaves all around him fall victim to the vamps two grab someone someone kicks open the door and races in as a few flee
seated in a chair someone smirks while two of his underlings hold someone on his knees one story up two vampires in a mural turn they leap from a ledge in front of the painting and claw the floor
charging they disappear someone throws his hat at one then strikes him down he takes down the other in a strike
swinging at a third someone drops his ax he delivers a powerful roundhouse kick as more and more vampires join the fray a staring someone backs away from the window one vampire seizes someones ax the hunter kicks him away and twirls it into an upward swing taking out one vamp after another looking on someone discreetly works through ropes binding his wrists an invisible vampire grabs a sword then materializes to attack someone disarms him but three more him
as he swings at one it vanishes another swipes his claws someone ducks them then embeds his ax in the abdomen
in slow motion he wrenches the weapon out sending a splash of blood through air
as he finishes the vampire off someone frees himself and fights off his captor someone kicks him into a pillar splintering its wood propelling himself off another pillar someone takes out two vamps in a single swing someone stalks towards him as he fights a third someone beheads his foe and finds someone in pants swirling her long skirt like a cape slicing through it he finds gone
from behind she kicks him to the floor as someone throws her a chair she backflips through the air catches it and lands in the seat on top of someone straddling the chair she peers down at face
she pins his arms beneath boot
the high mural becomes an animated depiction of slavery throughout history
he crouches someone
standing someone away
a vamp someone
struggles
someone puts a dagger to throat
the horse drawn carriage crashes through window
someone fights free as someone drives in the carriage skids in blood knocking someone off of someone he grabs ax
he and someone catch up to the carriage and climb on to the back it loses a wheel as it speeds out but continues down the dirt path later run
they halt in tracks
a team of approach
the mochaskinned woman rows raft
the three man dash from the riverbank and find the raft waiting for them trees hide them as the horsemen ride past with a colony of bats swooping overhead on the raft the men and their rescuer low
as the danger passes someone stands and takes up the long oar
at dawn we gaze out over the bayou
later the raft arrives at a shore facing a stately church
someone gets off first and helps others
he and someone pull the raft up on shore then follow the woman someone
a pastor comes out to them
now as someone climbs into attic
someone offers a hand to help up
runaway slaves fill the cramped space
many slumber lie down on unused pews while some curl up on floor
a baby lies in a cradle
someone and someone go to a shuttered window and peer through while tubman takes up rifle
someone bumps bell
outside someone up
as someone looks on anxiously someone waves the search on
he relaxes and faces speed sighs
someone bounces the baby it
craning her neck tubman regards the newcomers with a brow
now in the rain protesters hold up pro and antislavery signs someone works his way through the crowd inside someone douglas
later someone stands by as someone paces the chamber
the men turn someone comes in and greets the men with a smile
someone shoots a cutting look at someone who lowers gaze
someone twirls ax
someone lays the ax in chest
now our view spirals from sideways to upright as a door opens and a tall silhouetted figure through
clad in a trim long coat and the famous stovepipe hat someone marches resolutely towards us as he draws near we find him aged distinguished
sporting his trademark presidential beard now before the capitol with its dome construction
as a canon fires words appear fort sumter 1861 within the fort union and confederate troops clash in a chaotic battle as smoke fills the air a bearded union general leads a charge now the wall of a toy fort topples as a young boy plays in the office
as someone reads a letter arrives
the men turn and the boy looks up from play
someone lowers his troubled gaze and someone away
a gracefully aging someone approaches the desk with a meal on tray
she plants her hands on her hips and her gaze falls on headline
20000 dead
someone shifts his sorrowful gaze and someone out
the young boy follows mother
the pauses
turning around he returns to his fathers desk and kisses his cheek
the boy goes to his namesake who kisses cheek
beaming shyly the little boy leaves with a stride
someone gazes after him lovingly as someone tosses down paper
the emancipation proclamation lies him
he signs it now congress
outside capitol
now in the white house a maid uses a feather duster on a clock someone
later she smiles and nods demurely as she someone
someone pauses briefly looking over her shoulder at the woman
someone slips into a bedroom where someone wears a union uniform as he plays with soldiers
she shuts door
coming close someone lays down on stomach
props herself on her elbows and chats sweetly with child
as he answers her she glances over shoulder
someone blows a toy horn and they share a smile
his hand close to hers he presents a gleaming toy sword made silver
she takes his hand and kisses his wrist the toy sword drops to carpet
now someone comes in as someone lies sick bed
sitting with someone on the bed he notices dark swollen veins branching from a bite on the boys wrist someones eyes widen and he stands watching him someone notices his stricken gaze as he away
stepping away someone crosses to a window
someone turns and faces questioningly
staring off someone remembers his dying mother writhing as her eyes rolled back in head
now the president wakes in a chair at bedside
stretching he finds someone sleeping on the bed cradling their son in arms
moving gingerly someone gets to feet
his gaze lands on a spot on carpet
he drapes his jacket over someone like blanket
then crouches at his toys the silver pocket watch gleams them
someone picks it up and opens it revealing someones inscription
he lifts his gaze
now someone steps out onto a balcony on a beautiful day pauses
turning he finds someone sitting on concrete
his long legs stretched out him
he slumps dejectedly against pillar
someone crosses to his lifelong friend and drapes his jacket around shoulders
stepping in front of someone he crouches and touches arm
someone offers a sympathetic gaze then straightens and stands him
the president looks up him
someone draws a deep knowing breath and off
nighttime a carriage rides past the mistenshrouded house
in the presidential home someone kneels at someones bed prayer
before him the lifeless child wears a suit
his hands demurely
someone comes in and sinks to his knees at the other side of bed
the president lifts his head staring off as he rubs his together
looking past someone someone finds someone arriving in the doorway dressed mourning
someone stands someone wearily
she beats chest
overwhelmed with sobs someone rushes from room
someone starts to go then pauses in doorway
someones eyes widen and he lowers his gaze
now a photographer stands in the middle of a field littered with the bodies of soldiers
in the office
leaving the room he hands over a order
on someones plantation we zoom up the path leading to door
it opens as he walks out a man with a chin
a servant brings beverages
someone takes up goblets
someone returns goblet
sipping his drink someone spits it out splotches of red stain a war map in hand
our view zooms in on a red stain north of gettysburg which becomes a smoking field beneath an overcast sky swooping low we find confederate soldiers charging recklessly over the grass as cannon balls touch down all them
union soldiers fire the canons from a ridge
as a cannonball touches down with a stories high blast confederate soldier march straight towards it a row of cannon barrels amid smoke and sparks as they fire in the infantry below a thin union soldier clutches a photo of a woman as he stands by the general
the thin soldier aims a rifle with brothersinarms
a cannon ball blasts behind confederates
one or two fall but the rest charge on seemingly unharmed by the bullets they drop their rifles the thin soldier faces general
a pale confederate runs on despite a blood spraying chest wound and a bullet through his hand another bears his fangs as the general shoots the confederates vanish a force knocks his head off and his men fall him
a confederate flag topples to ground
the general turns and finds the thin soldier spitting up blood him
he holds up a shaking hand and a shaft of light shining through a hole in his chest hits palm
he sinks to his knees then over
turning the general finds every man in his unit sprawled on ground
the thin soldiers photograph of his sweetheart flutters down to the grass the general stares at the confederates
now someone and someone dine at opposite ends of a table
someones sips her drink and takes up soupspoon
someone turns the silver utensil in hand
someone watches him with wide eyes the president springs up from seat
he shows utensil
now union soldiers move in and out of wealthy residences bringing out bulging sacks and armloads of silver items as we peer down through the clouds we find carts loaded with silver twinkling in the sunlight as they travel through the streets someone enters his house and peers out a window through his sunglasses now speed rides in a carriage someone
someone eyes the uneasily
in a factory someone watches workers melt silver
someone joins him at a high railing overlooking the floor
the molten silver churns in enormous vats someone faces his old friend who looks down with a gaze
now fog drifts over the white house lawn dusk
in someones room someone lies in the small bed in a demure nightgown
she keeps her melancholy gaze averted as arrives
he sits close his back her
someones expression softens as she stares towards the windows one hand tucked behind head
she rolls her head to him
someone sits up her long hair hanging loose around shoulders
someone turns over his shoulder to meet gaze
wearing a vulnerable frown she takes a breath
someone slumps regretfully then puts his arms her
the aging couple lies back on the bed in a embrace
someone fingers someones toy sword as someone cups her hand his
someone hosts her in the room
now the attic opens
light pours in past someone as he stands in the doorway staring at the now dust chest
he crosses to it slowly taking out key
unlocking it he lifts the lid and in
someone pensively takes out his specialized ax and finds the silver along the untarnished
tipping it he holds it firmly in both hands and regards nostalgically
someone slowly twirls the weapon in hands
gaining confidence he builds speed until the ax spins in blur
it slips from grasp
bracing one hand on the chest someone clenches a fist and softly pounds the lid
in a tent
wearing his broadbrimmed hat someone leans forward his hands on table
with someone someone
in gettysburg someone strides to the open flap of his tent where someone post
someone slides his pocket watch over a trajectory marked on a map it becomes a locomotive speeding along a track in darkness
sidling along the engines railing
someone reaches the front and wipes off headlamp
he climbs back into the engine car where someone writes in journal
pausing the president looks up at his friend
heading further into the car a sootsmeared someone catches someone watching him and pauses with frown
he shifts gaze
someone regards his old friend solemnly a net of chains rattles over someones head as he returns the gaze with a smile
removing a pair of spectacles the president takes up his ax and turns away now on a narrow path in the woods someone someone and a few underlings approach on horseback facing them ms tubman stays someone who draws up her hood
riding ahead someone passes ms tubman and looms over someone on horse
she halts close to the first lady who keeps her hidden
someone draws a long slim blade and points it at head
she pushes her hood back a inches
someone obeys
someone stares as the vampires ride off from whence came
behind the first lady dozens of africanamericans emerge from hiding with sacks baskets
they join someone on the path out washington
meanwhile the locomotive races through darkness
stepping into the car behind it someone slides its shut
stacks of crates fill both sides of car
stepping past someone pauses raises his ax turns
from the engine someone leans out a window and spots several vampires leaping onto the cars
he lunges back into the car with a smile in a freight car someone loads his sixshooter with rounds
pausing he up
someone frowns and gets to his feet readying gun
a lantern swings from its post over his head as he steps over the wood floor
turning he raises weapon
he moves to a shuttered hatch and slides it open aiming into darkness
someone slides it shut then turns to face another shuttered hatch he takes aim and reaches out to it
hands burst through the baseboards and grab his ankles someone falls back and the vampire starts to pull out
he fires a gun in each hand then free
someone limps to crate
as he looks up a vampire leaps from the shadows grabbing his guns someone fires taking him down he puts his back to the wall and aims in either direction arms burst through the wood and hug him from behind the wounded vampire rises but someone shoots him through the forehead his guns fall from his grasp as he struggles against the vampire holding him he fights his way free then grabs a huge pistol and blows the monster away the kickback sends someone to the floor beside the dead vampire he opens a door behind the monster letting him away
as he slides it shut countless more vampires leap onto the roof someone hobbles to car
goes
now between two cars
someone glances at the barrel of ax
someone gives him a bullet then shakes his hand someone heads back inside as his friend climbs up to the rail cars roof inside someone stabs a vampire with a bayonet attached to the butt of his ax he pulls the weapon out then ducks past another lapping off his head on the roof someone draws two pistols and shoots a vampire in slow motion the monster flies past him spraying blood another charges and someone fires in slow motion the shot rips through the shoulder
baring his fangs he lunges at someone someone flings him aside but loses his balance nearly stepping over the edge
he regains his footing and hurries on to a vampire turning a hand wheel sparks fly from a wheel of the train someones guns misfire the vampire bares his hideous fangs someone lunges pushing the ghoul to the next rail ahead
rising to his knees he turns the hand wheel disengaging the brake meanwhile someone wedges his ax into a ceiling beam and dropkicks a vampire away he goes to finish his enemy but finds only shards of wood on floor
the vampire jumps on his back forced toward an open door someone braces himself with his ax the vampire tries to bite his neck but he flips his foe out of the rail car decapitating him as he shuts the door the vampires head lies at his feet someone boots it out on the roof still turning the hand wheel someone watches his enemy rise to feet
someone turns head
the vampire falls aside revealing someone standing halfway through a hatch his modified ax in hand someone spots a vampire climbing on to the roof he grabs his partners weapon and attacks the new arrival knocking the monster over the edge he tosses the ax back to someone who chops into another with someones blade stuck in his fallen foe a vampire attacks with kicks and punches as someone fends off the attacker someone lifts his ax twirls it releasing a spray of blood then slashes off the vampires head in the same swing he strikes another vampires midsection he massacres another slashing his face several times then passes the ax to someone someone takes out two vampires then twirls the ax behind his back to someone who spins the versatile weapon and strikes another vampire with its butt through a veil of windswept steam someone vanquishes yet another vampire he brings his ax down more
the steam dissipates to reveal someone clutching the ax handle he kicks someone sending the president back someone lands between the railcars in a tangle of chains someone breaks the axhandle over his knee as someone climbs back onto the roof someone hurls knife
the knifes tip nears someones face but the calm vampire tilts his head and dodges the blade someone charges someone but gets knocked off feet
as he slides head first over the edge someone grabs ankle
revolvers fall from the dangling mans pockets as the train speeds alongside a wall someone nearly crashes into some rocks
someone clutches collar
someone sinks his teeth into flesh but finds himself biting arm
he kicks off the passing rock wall and lands facing his rival as someone ducks a punch the pair gets jostled atop the last railcar meanwhile someone exhales a puff of smoke
with a match she lights a rope sending flames up beam
as she marches off a massive fire consumes the entire support structure of a bridge someone catches someones arm then flips him grabs his leg and slams him through the roof with an avalanche of broken wood the vampires crash land on the floor of the railcar someone rises to his feet and slams someones face through the top of a crate
someone lifts the laughing vampire from the box then shoves him aside and peeks in the himself
he pulls out a rock
then looks up from the stone with a gaze
he tosses the rock and crosses to another crate inspecting the cargo he finds more rocks in place of silver
someone angrily paces away he kicks open another crate spilling rocks on floor
someone boots someone back into a corner the evil glares
as the train nears the burning bridge someone eyes the blaze from the locomotive he pulls back a lever uses a piece of wood to keep it in place then leaves the controls he enters the first railcar and staggers past the cargo
meanwhile someone helps someone onto the roof they rise to their feet and spot the burning bridge up ahead they start for the locomotive but short
they back
they run back across rooftops
making his way through the railcars someone finds a floor strewn with broken wood he spots someone unconscious on his back then looks up through the ceiling
turning around he finds himself face to face someone
someone grabs throat
someone and someone arrive to see someone bite into neck
the vampire looks up at them now as the train passes over the burning bridge the track splits and the last railcar breaks loose from the train left behind the railcar teeters over a ledge sending someone and someone sliding down its roof about to fall into the blaze below they daringly leap across the divide and land on the next rail roof
as whats left of the train races onward the burning bridge collapses in its wake jostling inside a railcar someone braces himself and someone rises to his knees their railcar breaks free from the train crashing into the support structure below track
someone leaves the downed railcar emerging from thick smoke he crosses the support structure and kicks out beam
the track under the last railcar gives out and the railcar flips forward forcing someone and someone to run on to the next someone kicks out another support beam someone and someone fall to the structure under the track then hurry along beams
someone back
someone marches them
he vanishes someone slings the silver pocket watchs chain around fingers
he drives his fist through the vampires chest then pulls it out awash with blood his mouth agape someone falls flat on back
someone and someone notice the track collapsing above them each clings to a pillar as the locomotive lands on the lower level they jump into the open trailer of the locomotives coal car as the remaining bridge buckles the locomotive struggles to climb the increasingly inclined track someone peeks over the side glimpsing the burning structure underneath he and someone make their way across the engine the locomotive  s wheels spin kicking up sparks before the engine reaches the end the bridge underneath it splits from the final portion of the track someone and someone brace themselves clinging to the engine more sparks fly as the train begins to slide backward just before it slips off the edge the locomotive starts to climb the track
a massive black cloud of smoke rises from the abyss and blots out our view of play
drawing back we find someone lying on the twisted end of track
someone hobbles over him
he reaches out and gives him hand
the president helps his mentor to his feet then they both remain hunched over catching breath
someone and someone look someone
in the daytime at a bustling military camp someone opens a box filled with blades
she joins a few soldiers another
our view raises from their tent ascending a flagpole for a glimpse of the entire camp as runaway slaves arm the union soldiers with the silveroutfitted weaponry someone walks through camp
clutching her left arm and breathing heavily she notices a crate garlic
chatting with the commander someone spots someone peeking around tent
she grabs a nearby rifle and heads after vampire
someone comes out of hiding and faces her squarely standing about ten away
someone rips a silver chain with someones miniature sword from neck
as the vampire charges someone drops the chain down the barrel of her gun she takes aim at her assailant
she shoots someone and the vampire lands on her back the silver sword dangling from a hole in her head now a soldier loads a silver ball into cannon
a union infantry fires on a confederate blitz their bullets tearing through the vampires bodies the infantry commander shout charge and his men engage the enemy with bayonets
amid the chaos of battle a soldier stabs the top of a vampires head then pulls his blade out and runs on a line of cannons fire and a number of explosions erupt across the battlefield one rips a apart
as the carriage fades away the finished washington monument appears in the distance marine one descends to the white lawn
our view draws back from the screen of a smartphone as a live news report shows the helicopter down
sitting at a bar a man thumbs a text message on device
he downs a shot then gestures to bartender
beside him someone takes off a pair of sunglasses
he slaps them on the back and a pistol falls on floor

through a curtain the young man enters the nightclub
in a booth a man sits with several young beauties someone nuzzles the hair
the young man faces the man in booth
someone makes call
he raises his gun to the man in booth
the young man shoots him in the chest someone tackles him and our view cuts black
bullets tear a hole through the backside of a target
the target glides forward to someone
setting his weapon down the aging bald cop removes his glasses
someone faces a man with a badge around neck
leaning next to the cop someone looks at a file in hand
someone gives him a cool glance
someones stony expression softens as he shifts gaze
someone tilts his head and leans toward friend

their probing light leads back to a group of figures in black suits
vertical lights flicker on illuminating corridor
the file is in the vault

another wave hits the rocks and his head pops out of water
his outstretched hands lap against surface
he tries to shake the salty water off face
the girl watches in anguish as another wave rolls him
foam down
his white tennis shoes dangle helplessly toward deep
as a yellow shape floats overhead a hand reaches down and pulls him up by the scruff of collar
a shaggy haired man with the same colored beard lays the boy face first on surfboard
he glances over his shoulder and paddles his muscular arms hard
as a 15foot wave begins to crest he drops down through the face it
the front of the board bounces through the breaking wave as they safely
the girl watches then runs to meet them with the dog tow
as they glide through calmer water someone looks around with an ecstatic grin
the man drives them along a coastal road in his boxy van
his rescuer narrows eyes
night falls as the van heads into a town
words appear santa cruz 1987
the van pulls up beside a house
as the man turns back to the wheel someone knocks on window
he rolls window down with a look
he ahead
he puts the van park
the man nods and away
as someone pushes his bike he turns back to see the van park a few doors down street
the girl watches holding her dog as the man out
he away
someone looks at girl
she gives him a peck on the cheek and away
someone blinks with a smile
the man passes through a white picket fence pauses
beyond a window a demure dark haired woman bounces a crying baby in arms
the man hesitates someone flicks on light
he sets his jacket on counter
he notices a us armed forces savings check for 400 payable someone
he spots a crumpled handwritten note atop an unopened envelope marked due
as he reads the note his creases
he looks off then hurries down hall
he stops in doorway
in the dim light of a lamp
a blonde woman lies on her side in a bed
someone creeps in and picks up a bottle on nightstand
sniffing it recoils
as he turns to go she reaches for hand
she rolls onto her back one arm bent over head
she looks at him through eyes
she away
he takes bottle
in the kitchen he pours its contents down drain
taking off his shirt someone passes a couch and a divider that separates the living room from bed
an envelope on his reads
he turns on the light and takes it in his hands looking down it
later he places a wooden cigar box on his bed and sets the unopened inside
in his dimly hit kitchen the sandy haired man unscrews the top of canister
he opens a blue cabinet and the top hinge loose
the dark haired woman in
he leans down and her
she away
dawn breaks over a rundown cottage with a drive
inside a cleaned up radiant someone stands him
he watches her walk out a hopeful smile on face
later a clock on the wall 115
nibbling on pretzel rods someone sits at the kitchen table it
with a sigh rises
he opens the doors of a shed and pads barefoot
an old bicycle rests beside a bunch of tools
someone squats down and looks behind a metal shelf
he hoists up a dirty six foot surfboard
examining a crack running horizontally across deck
laying the board flat he paints a thin layer of glue along the crack with a applicator
he grimaces then picks up the can pouring it along the length of crack
he presses the board together and the clear glue bubbles up from the seam
he squints around shed
now he duct tapes the seam flips the board over and smooths it across the side
he looks down the length of the board to the tail and finds three slits
sighs
now in a baggy black wet suit he lugs the board over to the shaggy haired house
in the front yard his wife sits on the grass with another woman and her girl
the woman opens the doors of a wellstocked surf shed and walks to back
someone gazes at two paddle boards stored overhead then over to a red board
she notes the look of wonder on face
a picture of someone on a wave
she hands him fins
now someone walks down the street to the beachfront struggling to keep the board under arm
he takes a rundown path passing graffiti that reads surf where live
a man sips from a bag
surfboards lean against a rusted guardrail
someone rounds a corner and stops gazing past a cliff to the below
a long gentle wave rolls toward dozens of surfers
behind him a boy smashes a side view mirror with bat
the boy scowls under his black knit cap and off
with a furrowed brow someone heads down to water
a trio of surfers his own age sits on the sand by boards
they watch someone pass lugging his old board
he stops and looks out at waves
someone on his bright yellow long board drops into a gentle curl
he rises and crouches carving up and down the face of wave
with each effortless swerve his fingertips graze water
someone grins entranced
someone smacks the lip of the wave glides back down and crosssteps up board
with his left foot planted on the nose he bows his head letting the lip of wave wet hair
someone purses his lips with determination and in
now lying on his stomach he out
two surfers paddling in front of him duck dive under an wave
someone takes a deep breath and lowers head
the board crashes over break
he holds on shaking his drenched head and paddling
another wave of froth rushing into him pushing back
he shakes it off again and paddling
farther out a round faced boy sits on his board observing with a look
as another break hits someone the board goes vertical and flips out of hands
the round faced boy shakes head
someone surfaces blood trickling from mouth
the boy over
someone struggles back onto board
someone shoots him an look
he puts his hand on tail
they look over shoulders
a swell builds them
on the beach someone turns around watches
someone paddles and pushes onto his hands knees
he brings his left foot up then right
crouching he lets go of rails
a grin pulls at lip
hunched over and jaw hanging slack someone up
the cliffs get closer as he glides across the water shore
words appear seven later
a curly haired teenage someone runs his hand along a wave as he easily carves up and down face
clad in a blue sleeved wetsuit he maneuvers around other paddling surfers then crosssteps up board
he crouches down swerves his board back to the lip and rides it down
now he does a floater riding along the top of curl
high above on the cliff a teenage boy scowls watching him with buddies
someone finishes by carving up the top of the wave and leaping over it with his hands on rails
wearing an eartoear grin he paddles shore
he nears a younger surfer as a swell creeps up them
the novice gets to his feet another teen holds out his arm in indignation
the scowling boy sits with his pals at the top of the steps tapping a bat in hand
someone gives it a light tap and on
someone and blond carry their surfboards down street
a teenage girl with long blonde hair climbs into a rainbow colored bus
as she climbs into the passenger seat and shuts the door someones fades
he gazes after the van as it away
someone off
he races through an open door to find someone on the floor
a man stands her
someone grabs man
the man out
someone tackles him out the door
they land on grass
blond tries to pull someone off as a police car rounds corner
across the street someone stands with his hands in his pockets watching scene
someone throws blond off of him and looks up to see frowning
the older surfer away
now someone races down a darkened beach to waves
he leaps onto the board and paddles out away from the flashing lights of boardwalk
he sits up on the board letting his feet dangle in water
now on his bed someone sketches a surfer entering tube
using a pen on notepaper he adds intricate detail to drawing
nearby a trophy bearing his name stands by an alarm clock 400
in his sweats someone sits up and peeks out a window to find someone heading out to his van across street
in the darkness he hefts a surfboard up to roof
someone hurriedly grabs his things and rushes out door
he dashes down the quiet street
as someones van away
he hops onto the rear bumper clutching ladder
at the wheel someone rides on the roof
the van passes a sign marking california 1n
someone stares at it then zips up jacket
now the van travels through misty hills in the pale light dawn
later it follows a coastal road that ascends parallel to a shelf of dizzying cliffs
now fishing boats drift in a calm bay as the van follows a winding uphill
still on the roof someone clutches the front bar of the surfboard rack as he rides on belly
ahead a man gets out of an pickup
someone climbs down the back of the van and off
as the van passes between posts
someone blocks them off with chain
crouched in nearby brush someone creeps closer on a ridge ahead three athletic dark haired men in wetsuits wait surfboards
one with close cropped hair crouches waxing down
carrying a cherry red board someone joins the men and greets the shorthaired one with a handclasp
the men head off with boards
creeping around a knoll we find them descending a path
cutting through a slope blanketed vegetation
peering over a ridge someone finds the men approaching a small isolated beach at the base of slope
the team moves along the ridge keeping his eager gaze fixed on the surfers
from the sandy beach the four men trot into the water and stretch out on boards
as they paddle far out we spot a meteorological complex complete with a satellite dish perched on a bluff in distance
someone skirts around the end of a chainlinked fence and dashes along edge
staggering he finds his balance then out
on the water waves swell and crest several high
their powerful crashes send up massive bursts of foam
a cleanly breaking wave forms a tube
wearing a wetsuit with a billed hood
someone paddles his board up a wave
someone pants excitedly his lips curled into a smile
the older surfer faces a cresting wave that towers stories him
someone follows his friends to the top then rides his board down the side
from the distant bluffs someone appears as a tiny speck as he on
one of someones friends takes a wave and rides down the face
the men take one wave after another their boards cleanly skimming the glassy water beneath feet
someones shoulders heave as he takes in spectacle
one surfer skirts just ahead of the white water which seems to him
two others share a broad section of the waves face
near shore a wave crashes violently against a huge jagged formation
further out a swelling wave fills view
someone glances over his shoulder as he paddles along face
as someone looks on ecstatically the older surfer pops up at the crest
then rides his board 20 feet down the face
the wave breaks behind him forming an oncoming mass of churning water
someone reaches the foot of the wave briefly vanishing from view within the rolling tides before he emerges to take more of face
he skirts the ends of the pursuing white water staying up as the diminishes
someone joyfully raises fists
looking around someone spots the teen on bluffs
as someone catches his breath the older man regards gravely
now in the van
someone gives a nod
someone slaps a small cube shaped weather radio perched on a cup tray
someone shifts his gaze and gulps then him
later the van pulls up in front of house
a short board hangs over the door
someone cuts the ignition
beside him the teen shifts his gaze
but lingers in seat
the boy stares at lap
someone glances toward someones house and understandingly
someone and someone climb out of van
someone and someone clasp hands
he backs the teen against shed
someone swaggers into shed
he gathers up tools
someone stares up at earnestly
someone away
shaking his head the teen turns away and home
someone hefts a box of tools supplies
coming out of the shed he gazes someone
turning he finds his wife watching from the front door of home
as she slips inside he follows her to a nursery
she gives him a look
someone stares as his wife with a furrowed brow then concedes a nod
later in his shed he tends to his cherry surfboard
other boards rest in a rack at the back of shed
taking a break someone thoughtfully wipes his hands off with rag
at pleasure pizza someone ladles sauce over shredded cheese on a disk dough
putting the order in blond notices handiwork
someone spots someones outside
he out
as someone drives away a grin spreads across features
he pumps fists
now someones watch reads 630 as he waits in the doorway of shed
someone jogs into view carrying surfboard
he points to the two paddleboards
now in wetsuits they each carry board
someone taps a car with board
now they carry the boards into surf
later on calm waters they kneel on their boards
they bend over paddling both hands through the water at the time
brackets on the boards hold bottles
they pause and up
at night a figure jumps from a tree to a second story window of house
inside someone reads on bed
sofie leaves her side to greet someone at window
someone over
clad in a silky robe someone beams at fondly
now a skateboard rolls over a sunlit bump
as someone rides it up the street blond skateboards a short distance him
as his friend splits off someone pauses in front of an electronic store window
the young surfer notices a weather radio priced 89
in the window glass a reflection shows blond passing something off to two of bullies
someone gazes after his friend with a frown
then follows him off on skateboard
they take turns jumping another bump
now outside an abandoned house a hammock hangs over a patio
in a drained swimming pool a kid with glasses and a hunters cap preform skateboarding tricks on the concrete
blond joins him skateboarding up and down the walls of basin
at the rim someone holds onto a fence as he flips his board with feet
the glass of the houses sunroom reflects the three teens as they skateboard in and out of the pool
the bespectacled kid out
recovering he takes a smooth turn around pool
the bespectacled kid practices more
blond taps him on the stomach then joins their friend
later someone rides a bike up to house
working on the roof someone climbs down a ladder and carries his over
he sets the tools in van
someone picks up a shovel
he leaves someone clutching the shovel by a large pile someone
now we float over the santa cruz boardwalks giant rollercoaster
someone paddles on water
someone stops paddling then rolls off his board and into water
someone halts and back
the gently rolling current shows no sign of boy
he pops up and shakes out curls
someone shakes his head and faces sea
now at home someone makes a poster charting his goals
one bar tracks the miles monterey
while another counts 4 minutes in increments
he hangs the poster on two panels of corkboard on wall
now sipping tea in kitchen
someones wife flips through a small book of black and white pictures
someone makes sandwich
someone chuckles fondly at his wife as she eyes the wistfully
as he turns away she leaves table
steps in close and rubs back

someone smiles enviously as the veteran starts a drop
the surfer suddenly falls off the board and the colossal wave smashes down him
someone drops his notebook and stands

he pulls books
his smiles
she watches with glistening eyes as someone shuffles to a partially open door at the end of hall
now someone and someone surfboards
nearing a rocky shore someone pauses and looks back her
stopping on the winding path someone smiles and follows onward
now stars twinkle in a clear sky
standing at someones side someone beams at affectionately
someone returns his solemn gaze to sky
someones smile fades and she regards compassionately

she gets to feet
someone surfs his board close to hers and out
the two hands
losing their balance they fall off boards
someone surfaces with someone and shakes his out
the blonde beauty grins joyfully and gives him a splash
now someone and someone propel their paddleboards over sunlit glassy waters hued a deep blue
the two pause and sit up straddling boards
someone trails his fingertips through water
squinting in the sunlight someone sips from his bottle
from underwater we gaze up at the surfer
its rippling surface distorts his gaze
now the two walk along a misty beach
someone emphatically
now the light of a low sun casts a rosy glow on waves
at night someone and someone dance together by a campfire as two women sing and ukuleles
someone beams as she watches parents
perched in a portable chair someone looks appreciatively
holding each other close someone and someone gaze into each eyes
he kisses her lips and her
someone takes hand

sneering he opens it reads
someone faces blond who returns his remorselessly
someone tosses the notebook over and it lands in dirt
his cheeks flushed someone lowers his gaze

someone backs away from him and picks up notebook
steeling himself he walks past bullies
at an isolated nighttime beach someone crouches over his surfboard and waxes aggressively
later his board rests on a chair outside as he in
shuffling through kitchen
he puts on his wristwatch and notices a stack of mail on table
amid the envelopes he finds one with his name scrawled in red ink beside someones crossed name
he finds a single notation at the top of his latest essay deeper
now someone marches into someones shed where his mentor tends to board
he tosses down envelope
someone in
following her into the kitchen someone and someone find someone sprawled on floor
someone rushes her
someone cradles her as someone rushes to phone
her face pale someone off
someone cradles head
now the sun shines wanly through a thick haze and gleams on a calm sea
wearing a black suit someone stares out at the water with a brow
also in black someone jogs out from a church and around
passing arriving mourners the teen spots his mentor across street
someone arrives in a dark jeep
glancing toward someone someone approaches the pretty teen who wears an gaze
someone shakes head
catching sight of someone he bites lip
someone regards her grieving friend with eyes
she gives an nod
taking deep breaths someone off
someone looks over her shoulder and finds him approaching mentor
someone stands with both hands braced on a railing his tie loosened
someone fiddles with his wristwatch as he nears his friend
keeping his gaze ahead
someone works mouth
his clenches
the teen turns and takes a few back
but nearby
a tall bald man with a white mustache over
he steps up beside someone and faces expectantly
his brow furrowed the older man turns his face toward water
someones eyes well tears
someone gives a sorrowful nod and faces the man
as the older leaves
someone stares at his helplessly
later the teen enters his house
in bed someone lies on back
as someone comes in and sits on the edge of mattress
she scoots over to make room him
the teen shifts his pensive gaze then lies down beside mother
stare at the ceiling their hands folded over chests
someones chest sags in a sigh
she rolls over to face son
on an overcast day someone brings a pizza to house
he steps through the wideopen gate and swings it shut him
finding the front door standing ajar he inside
he brings the in
he turns and his widen
the kitchen stands in shambles the cabinets heavily battered and torn from hinges
someone shifts his gaze
stepping outside he approaches the shed and peers in with a gaze
in one corner and empty armchair faces a tv that plays a home movie of someone with one of babies
someone notices an empty water bottle on the floor beside a broken rod
looking up he finds one of the gone
someone hurriedly takes down the other board ducks down and carries it from shed
now he paddles over the speedily
his board glides swiftly over the gently water
someone looks around anxiously and shakes water from hair
the surrounding current shows no sign of his mentor
someone gets up on his knees bends over and paddles both hands in strokes
we peer at the seemingly expanse
pausing someone looks helplessly
the teen pants hard and swigs from his water bottle then angrily throws down cap
his gaze fixes it
as the current carries the plastic cap away someones widen
someone flattens himself on his stomach and paddles in the direction of the softly waves
a lone dark shape appears on the ahead
kneeling someone picks up the pace and paddles with both hands in stokes
drawing near he finds his mentor sprawled out on board
someones board roughly bumps his arrival
someone shifts his gaze
his expression anguished his mentor turns his away
someone stares at his appreciatively
someone offers water
someone takes it sips
his bleary someone twists around and looks over shoulder
spying hills in the distance
he faces his protege with a surprised smile
the youth stretches out on his stomach and heads for the shore
his mentor closely
now pebbles dot a sandy beach nestled at the base of hills
rustic houses and a patio decorated with colorful fishing buoys form a barrier around the spot
our view drifts past the two paddleboards to find someone and someone sitting side by side enjoying accomplishment
now in his room someone uses a blue marker to fill the remaining empty space in the miles bar on his poster of goals
going to the kitchen he finds someone breakfast
he pauses at her appearance
she gestures to table
a colorfully wrapped present sits by a setting
someone holds cash
someone takes the uneasily
someone strides back to the stove and cooking
someones widen
grinning proudly someone pours juice
yielding a smile the teen goes to the table sits
his beaming mother looks on as she scoops scrambled eggs from pan
tearing off the wrapping paper someone reveals a radio
someone takes it from its box with a gaze
she brings breakfast
someone regards his smiling appreciatively
he gets up from seat
he kneels close to hers and gives her an hug
her brow furrowed someone holds tight
the teen blinks tears
now beneath a stormy sky slate hued waves roil and churn along coast
crashing violently into rocks
at the swimming pool rain pelts the patio
at a nine foot depth marker a bubble erupts at surface
kneeling underwater someone holds up a finger
an occasional air bubble slips between lips
but he maintains a expression
he curls in his finger surfaces and checks watch
its timer reads four minutes and seconds
now someone and someone enter shop
a square faced man them
he leads them down corridor
following them someone steps into a room with a gorgeously painted long board at center
the teen stares at it with an overwhelmed gaze then closer
peering at the green tipped board he glides a hand over its lemon yellow body appreciating the curves of design
his hand trails toward the front where the yellow hue blends into a deep red resembling sunset
someone clasps hand
now a wetsuitclad figure treads water
above the surface a green wave powerfully
silhouetted against the blue sky someone and his three surfing buddies gaze out at water
the swimming figure surfaces at the foot of wave
as someone smiles proudly someone allows one wave after another to crash down him
beside the mentor a friend of his with weathered features peers through eyes
out in the water someone submerges himself in wave
squinting in the sun his shortest friend wears a cap
as a giant wave rolls over the teen a surfing buddy with longer hair faces solemnly
now someone listens to his weather radio work
someone switches off his radio and leaves the deserted kitchen
unlocking the front door he lets inside
she steps in past him halts then lowers the hood of raincoat
she wears a gaze
turning away she sinks down to floor
she sinks down to the floor and leans her back against a seat
someone joins her on floor
someone gives a smile
someone breathlessly
he stares at her imploringly but find her confused
someone leans close
someone follows example
their lips meet in a kiss
as they part she then kisses again
now a wave several stories tall fills our view as it continues to mass
it curls into a barrel as it breaks and sends up massive blasts of foam spray
the sea churns violently in wake
now someones surfing gear lies neatly on bed
the teen takes in his inventory with deep breaths
his gaze lifts to his drawing of a giant tentacle dragging a man down into sea
someones eyes dart toward his box
crossing the room he flips open the lid and dumps out contents
plucking out the envelope he rips it open and reads the within
his jaw muscles tense as he peruses his words
the teen lifts his disillusioned gaze swallows
now someone types out frosty
he pauses thoughtfully then proceeds with a glare
now from overhead we follow a giant wave as it rolls along the water toward bluffs
camped out on his couch someone rushes to the phone and it
someone steps out wrapping herself in sweater
ending the call he notices her gaze
she musters smile
she gives an nod
now someones van travels up the ocean highway
he shows someone a surfing magazine exposing the existence mavericks
in the back someone naps against shoulder
his face pale someone pants and queasily
as the van pulls over on the shoulder someone out
now the sun shines brightly on a slate blue sea rolling beyond the complex
a wave the size of a large house curls into a barrel filling our view with its foam
from a makeshift parking area countless surfers and spectators make their way toward beach
taking his new surfboard down from the vans roof someone pauses at the sight of approaching
behind him someone bundles up his beaming daughter as someone on
blond taps a buddy on arm
blond extends his fist and someone gives it a bump
smiling at him blond on
a white pickup arrives its bed loaded with rowdy surfers
standing with friend
someone observes gravely
his nods
the two men return to the side of the van where someone prepares wetsuit
someones buddy pats someones shoulder and out
someone understandingly
now massive waves roll in tiers toward the shore a breaking wave sends up a giant blast of foam spray
hiking down with his loved ones someone holds hand
a monstrous wave curls into a barrel big enough to hold bus
now in his wetsuit someone waxes his board on beach
he pauses staring out at the surf
someone arrives and kneels down him
someone takes in the roiling foamy waters crashing the bone yard then someone
taking in his resolute expression someone off
someones doubtful friend stands close to the edge
glancing at someone he pulls up his scalp hood
someone arrives at someones side crouches
nearby someones three buddies paddle out into water
staying by someones side someone lowers his gaze
someone takes this in then turns his gaze out toward water
his eyes glistening tearfully someone pats the youth stands
reaching into his supply bag someone produces letter
he gives it to his mentor then takes up his board and off
someone emotionally
adjusting his hood someone steps into the surf with the board under arm
someone walks up beside someone as the watch someone paddle out one foot in air
someone throws his arm her
the grey undulating ocean gathers itself up and rolls someone
further out someones three surfing buddies disappear over the top of a cresting wave
someone follows paddling up the wall of water and over the lip just seconds before breaks
the veteran surfers look back give him a respectful nod and they paddle on together as foursome
up ahead a blue boat and a smaller fishing boat lurch through the spray
motorized rafts race past them at bore
someone steps out of the cabin of the blue boat wearing wetsuit
he and his friends peer over the rail to see someone by
as he pounds on the cabin a veteran surfer shakes head
high on the bluffs with someone by his side someone raises a pair of binoculars to his eyes he watches as the blue boat lurches up and over a cresting footer
someones friends pitch their boards into the water and in
another surfer hops out of raft
they all paddle out to join about two dozen surfers sitting on boards
as the water swells one of the surfers drops down the face of a glossy wave
it quickly curls over him and he vanishes in barrel
on the bluffs someone shades her eyes as watches
someone sets jaw
someone wanders over to side
someone peers through the binoculars he watches as another surfer loses his balance halfway down the face of a wave
he falls off his board and vanishes in the break
someone watches as he out
now two surfers drop in dangerously close to another
one stumbles over sideways soon both are lost in a white thundering plume water
someone pushes up on the swell
but at the last moment he sits back on board
someone with a concerned look watches the next wave curl over a group of surfers as they paddle up face
it breaks fast
the surfers call to one another as they beat a path to right
now the waves break one right another
a nasty 30foot wave curls over itself
the blue boat floats dangerously close to the zone
the captain barks into radio
the raft riders power up over the lip bouncing back roughly
someone and the veterans perform turtle rolls flipping their boards on top of them and punching through safely to the side
as the 30 foot monster starts to break the group paddles up and over it in the someone time
through his binoculars someone watches a handful of surfers being rolled up into wave
someone draws a breath
frowns
the blue boat groans up a wave at a 30degree angle pitching side
it makes it over nearly capsizing as it slams down behind the boat
a rider bounces out of raft
an unmanned surfboard slaps against the back of swell
the foursome hurls themselves up and over a 25footer through a fog of spray
someone paddles at a steady pace breathing out through mouth
he eyes a building swell and sits up on board
he glances behind him first to the bluffs then to the station
he sizes up the wave one time
then turns around and paddles preparing to catch one
the veterans look over their shoulders and ahead
someone shields eyes
someone raises his binoculars to see someone arrowing down the face of a wave
his mouth open
on a fishing boat a white haired photographer with a battered baseball cap aims lens
someone shifts her weight parted
someone up
with the board jutting out perpendicular over the wave someone takes a stance
the camera captures image
the board vertical
the photographer lowers his camera to see the board tumble backwards behind wave
someone clutches someones arm as they watch the surf explode like volcano
it sends clouds of foam high into air
with a grave look one of someones buddies up
the others look back to see receding break fling someones tiny surfboard up and it
someone breathes hard watching anguish
someone takes a step forward his eyes locked on surf
under water someone flails his arms against turbulence
his ankle strap yanks him down
someone looks through his binoculars and spots his board sticking straight up out of turmoil
someone glances at someone terror
someone twists water
another monster wave down
the undertow churns likes a cloud
as the breaking wave rushes over someones board his ankle strap off
the board pops up into the air and twirls over the untethered
gasps
someone lowers binoculars
the veterans watch the white water ram into the treacherous rocks of the yard
someone shoots someone a look
on his hand one finger uncurls around the barrel of binoculars
slowly a second uncurls
the fishing boat makes it way over to board
someone soberly wipes his mouth chin
someone scans the bone yard but sees no sign someone
he lowers binoculars
the fishing boat hauls his board deck
someone uncurls a finger
an aerial of the bone yard reveals nothing but roiling foam
someone sighs dropping head
someone looks from someone to surf
someone emerges from water
she points to the tiny head and shoulders just before they disappear again in an surge
someone wears a look
someone pops out again tears off his hood and loosens collar
with her hand concealing a relieved smile someone glances someone
someone swims over to the boat
the photographer reaches down from stern
the photographer smiles turns
a deck hand brings the board and the photographer hands it down someone
the nods
someone lies down on his board and away
someone squints from bluffs
someone makes his way over swell
someone looks someone
a grin pulls at the corner of mouth
someone paddles by the blue boat as it takes in a board
exhausted surfers haul themselves rafts
another casualty pads along shore
the two halves of his board under arm
only a handful of surfers remain in water
sitting on his board someone turns as someone sits up next him
they watch crusher
someone stifles smirk
he leans down and paddles off as someone watches with a smile
on the bluffs someone squints down at the envelope in hand
as someone paddles out over swells
he reads the letter
he looks up to see someone rejoin his buddies
he sits on his board adjusting hood
the foursome look patiently out to sea where another swell begins build
in slow motion he surfs down a wave
as he reaches the bottom it breaks right him
someones drops
the avalanche of white water catches up behind fast
as he struggles to keep his balance it overtakes him and he again
someone and someone take breaths
the surfers aboard the blue boat watch
the frowns
a veteran surfers mouth open
suddenly someone emerges still surfing from the cloud spray
up on the bluff onlookers cheer clap
someone breaks into a smile and throws his arm around the someone
someone swerves right and shoots through the hollow letting the wave curl him
someone stands on the deck of the boat griping the rail watching
someone comes out of the barrel near the bone yard and speeds toward shore the froth nipping at heels
someone gives someone the letter leaves
as someone slows down he turns to see the veterans sitting on their smiling
one lifts his hands claps
with a grin someone heads shore
someone clutches throat
someone walks into the surf to meet someone and they throw their arms around other
now a magazine cover features the photo of his wipe out mavericks
a photo shows someone and together
now a man free dives in turquoise water
wearing only fins and shorts
he turns around and looks up at surface
bubbles float from nostrils
and three fingers curl into palm
someone curls another finger into his palm leaving only his up
now someone stands on beach
a knit black cap on head
he stares at the surf with his hands in pockets
he lifts his hand to the back of neck
and gives it squeeze
he turns to see someone looking up at him with pain in eyes
her part
he pensively
words appear seven years after his historic ride someone drowned while free diving in the maldives he was 22 old
now someone sits on a surfboard a white lei around neck
he scoops his hands through the water and throws it in air
beside him someone watches with a expression
someone looks on with a gaze
dozens of surfers around them toss water
someone in
everyone floating on surfboards and leis
splashes water into air
an aerial view shows their multicolored surfboards in circle
later they drive past forest
the young grins
they pull into a bustling high school lot
now with the car parked the camera stays on driver
now in hallway
several students by
a jokester waves his arms in front of camera
campaign posters show a smiling young man a girl brings one
a cheerleading squad practices nearby waving green and pompoms
someone sets up his camera on a bench him
watching the girls he grabs a bag chips
beyond him a circle of field hockey players stretch out on the line
the teenager glances back at his camera and eats chip
now a darkhaired cheerleader marches over and faces him from a railing
a shaggyhaired guy grabs camera
a darkhaired bully holds someone in headlock
the bully smacks him in the face times
the camera finds someone standing across hall
the camera slides across the floor and tips on side
someone picks up his camera then peers at lens
in his friends car again he points his camera at the mirror
the mirror shows him peering through eyepiece
he videotapes friend
at a little corner park three guys meet up toting bottles and bags
they someone
someones camera later
a stationary view shows someone sitting at a desk in bedroom
the pale teen connects a light attachment to camera
switches it on and smiles himself
someones father barges in and the nervous teen quickly acts busy at computer
he smacks someone upside the head lifts him from his chair and throws down
he lowers his finger
the bearded man storms out leaving the bedroom ajar

someone crawls through the air duct as more water weighs down spoon
reaching a grated cover she peers down at a male prisoner asleep in cell
as she crawls on by wakes
someone reaches a large ventilation fan and checks watch
the spoon falls and the water shorts out fan
at his desk the sergeant up
in the air duct the fan slows to stop
someone lies on her back and slithers her feet between blades
below doyle shuffles into the electrical room and eyes the cabinet
a red light glows on door
in the duct someone slides her chest between the blades then squeezes her arms down her side
doyle opens the cabinet as she works her shoulders through fan
he flips a switch
someone emerges safely on the other side just as the fan whirs back life
the policeman finds the plastic cup and shakes his head it
as someone crawls onward doyle chucks the cup in trash
now the intruder lowers a ceiling vent hatch and stealthily out
in the secure cell block someone finds his coffee empty
he checks someone
finding the prisoner asleep he shuffles to the cell block door and pushes button
he wakes the guard in the room
he buzzes through
later in a mens room the young someone sets the thermos on a sink and crosses to urinal
as he relieves himself someone slips out of the stall and creeps up him
she kicks him as he turns knocking him cold
now in the room
a monitor shows someone standing at the door to the secure cell block with his face hidden by his cap
the guard buzzes through
as the door opens the unconscious someone sinks to his knees then falls down
crouched in the hallway someone creeps in after him and gently pushes the shut
she takes gun

he notices the weapon and stares someone takes aim him
someone surrenders the gun and his fellow marshals him
someones dead body bears an orchid design drawn on his chest underneath the traitor
someone leads his men through a sweep of station
meanwhile someone kicks open a grated vent cover leading outside
in the alley officers run past the prison bus several stories above someone climbs out of the duct and clings to the wall the officers hurry up a set of emergency access stairs someone stretches her leg up to a shoulder high ledge as she climbs the officers arrive on rooftop
she reaches the ledge
her feet scramble up the brick wall propelling over
landing in a crouch she spots the police across rooftop
she breaks into sprint
crossing to the roofs edge she leaps over and grabs onto a pipe just beneath the side
her toes touch down on a ledge
she starts to reach up but withdraws her hand as an officer arrives her
he sweeps his flashlight over edge
flattening herself against the wall someone evades detection
the cop leaves and she pulls up
her legs accidentally sweep tiny bits of mortar off ledge
the someone lands behind two cops in an alley who turn and up
someone pulls herself into an air duct as an officer over

the station doors shut as she reaches the sidewalk and peels a rubbery substance off her hand
passing between two parked vans
she drops it on pavement
now someone warren watches arms folded as someone stands in cell
facing the cop the fbi agent aims an imaginary gun and visualizes the criminal
he looks up with a furrowed brow at the sizable cover
then peers down at the cot again and backs up toward the door
he steps out of the cell and notices the camera
now a video camera captures someone entering a lobby she discreetly brushes her hair over her face as she crosses the polished floor glass doors behind her show a bus parked at curb
she enters an employee room
she opens a locker and pulls out a purse and a bag

she takes out a cup of noodles she eats some with her hands as she crosses to a complex console
where she turns on a set of monitors

she sets the cup down then claps her hands and raises her arms above head
the live young assassin swivels her hips with sensual grace as she dances her way into a area

he cautiously looks down the hall then steps into a apartment
a single lamp shines on sketches taped all over walls
and candles burn throughout the space
the man steps further in passing an electric fan and a jar paintbrushes
he halts and turns around to find someone watching him from a sofa
she switches on lights
she smiles springs up and greets him with a kiss
his arms envelope her and his hands travel down back
someone abruptly ends the kiss and faces a stylized portrait of an man
someone peels off his jacket then removes her own as she resumes embrace
someone gently takes hold of wrists
grinning she pulls her dress off over her head to reveal her black bra and panties
she plants a kiss on someones lips then removes tshirt
his tattooed arms wrap her
and he lifts up
someones legs grip his waist as he carries her to sofa
he sits with her straddling lap
she lifts her head ecstatically and tilts it side to side as the handsome artist nibbles her neck and kisses chest

two sharks swim nearby paying little attention to the intruder
someone nears the opposite end of the pool and pushes up one of the thick panels
gripping its edge she slides away
her head breaks the waters surface and she peers into courtyard
pushing herself out of the pool she draws a gun at hip
she glances around as she screws a silencer onto barrel
with her fingers curled around the guns handle she hurries into mansion
in his bedroom the portly scam artist sleeps amid his scantily companions
someone marches quietly toward the bed water still glistening on her neck
she carries the gun at her side her finger crooked around trigger
halting a few yards from the foot of the bed she regards the ponzi schemer with a cold gaze
as she aims her weapon a blonde snuggles up to the portly man in sleep
draping herself across chest
our view arcs around someones gun until the silencer muzzle aims right us
a bright golden flash clouds view
someone bolts upright then looks down at his chest
he finds the words thief written in black lipstick above a drawing of the orchid

then shuts a case
as she loads an armored truck she notices the dogs her

he arrives at a door and through
its stenciled lettering reads stanley j someone chief surveyor
someone sits in chair
she aims gun
now at mansion
someone shifts his gaze to an open door straight away and sees a rocket flying right him

a crystal chandelier crashes to ground
as the flames give way to a haze smoke
someone and someones writhe
looking into the adjacent room someone finds his boss unconscious on floor

it continues to reverse driving over the mercedess hood and it
someone climbs out with a sub machine raised
she fires at car
as the barrage of bullets kills the men inside smoking casings pop out of her gun and shower ground
someone leads his away
they turn down corridor
he pushes a statue on wall
a panel behind the statue pushes inward to reveal a compartment
someone closes inside
meanwhile someone creeps through a crawl space under mansion
dust sprinkles down through the above
pressing her back to a wall she fires up through floorboards
as her shots hit a gunman others cover
the shooting ceases and the bullet riddled falls
someone peers out from room
a beefy gunman shows him a grenade and the bearded nods
the gunman tosses it over and someone pulls pin
he lobs it into the other room where it lands beside the gunman
the explosion tears into the floor and churning fire surges through the space
someone watches from a safe distance as smoldering someone down
in the hidden compartment someone presses his ear to panel
then takes out his cell dials
answers
stepping into the destroyed room the beefy gunman fires down the hole in floor
then jumps into the crawl space his weapon blasting
more follow
with the phone still to his ear someone aims a handgun as he cautiously steps toward hole
someone gives a look
a burst of bullets hits the gunmen in the space
hiding behind a pillar someone lowers phone
on the opposite side of the room someone stands on a mezzanine with a sub machine gun in hand
someone squeezes his eyes closed as her bullets hit the floor near feet
her shots rip side by side paths of holes in the wood then lift to three gunmen in the adjacent room killing one another
someone turns to the mezzanine and fires someone away
as a thin gunman and a bald one shoot up at the mezzanine someone rushes out of room

meanwhile someone slumps against a wall in compartment
setting his tinted glasses on the shelf someone watches the bathroom open
someone enters with her raised
as she kicks his pistol away he grabs her wrist and redirects aim
she releases the weapon catches it in her other hand and points at again
he grabs its barrel and strikes her in the head snatching it away as stumbles
he raises it and she grabs a glass off a shelf and hurls it him
she wraps a towel around his gun wielding wrist and pulls down as if operating a lever using her own shoulder as a fulcrum to break arm
yanking her ponytail back someone wiggles out of hold
she whips the towel at his hand and knocks the gun into tub
as she whips at him dodges
then grabs the towels end
she spins toward him punches him in the throat then him
holding him against a wall she strikes him over over
he shoves her away but she wraps the towel around his neck and starts to choke him behind

she swipes at him with a brush in hand
he grabs her wrists holding her back but she twists free and slashes him
spinning she backhands him with one of brushes
he charges grabbing her around waist
as she gets thrown against the wall the brushes fall from grasp
she lands a punch sending someone crumpling to the floor where he grabs the gun
as he points it at someone she quickly releases the weapons magazine from its hand grip then yanks the slide from the barrel and stabs him in the neck it
his droops
someone withdraws her hand trembling as she falls back exhaustion
she stares at the gangster
the clip juts grotesquely from neck
a bloody nosed someone scoots back him
her body quivering with sobs
meanwhile someone shifts his panicked eyes then opens the panel
back in the bathroom someone grabs phone
someone races to the garage and gets into van
spinning its wheel he steers past the mercedes
and squeezes between the armored truck and a wall side swiping both on his through
he speeds out a door and onto a road
with a frantic look he pulls onto the main road leading out of his estate passes through the front gate and swerves onto street
the van fishtails its spinning tires leaving a wake of dust
meanwhile someone exits mansion
turning a corner someone finds the road blocked by a truck
he answers a phone on the dash
turning someone sees her dogs in the seat
the dogs attack and blood splatters phone
a view from outside shows the shaking
blinking her weary eyes someone lowers her cell from her ear and sucks in an breath
a thin trickle of blood leads from nostril
to the tip of chin
warm sunlight washes over her face as she drops to her knees in the grass under a tree
she bows head

someone takes his cell back and heads out of room
as he leaves agent someone bows head
meanwhile someone brushes a tear from her eye then slides on a pair sunglasses
golden sunlight glows down on her as she turns away from the phone and dons hat
she strides toward a bus parked at the side of road
a woman sitting on a bench stares off with disinterested eyes as someone passes by then boards bus

the rider swings himself off of the monstrous vehicle flames glow within its engine and vents
the riders gloved fingers close around his heavy duty chain lightening casts a glow on the mustached thug as he holds his shotgun ready the chain links glow and the rider turns his scorched skull
staring someone rolls unsteadily in the gravel the riders head cocks erratically he raises his fist to his opposite shoulder then lifts his other hand and at angle someones slack jawed gaze shifts of the otherworldly creature to henchmen
the goateed thug shoots his bullets making glowing holes in the riders scorched leather jacket turning the creature slings his chain back grazing someones shoulder he flings it around the thug and gives it a yank incinerating him in a flash lowering his chain the rider sways side to side his head tilting to and fro a smudge of smoking embers stands in place of the goateed henchman the mustached thug eyes them fearfully then faces the swaying demonic creature the rider wheels around to face him in a rapid series of erratic movements the rider charges he stops inches from the mustached thug and looms him

jagged pink scars mar his flesh a pretty young nurse steps in through a ring curtain
he flops back on pillow
eyeing him uneasily the nurse leaves someone notices his jacket draped over a chair near a cabinet of drugs and medical supplies now he opens the cabinet and rummages through the drugs he takes two handfuls of pill bottles now fully dressed he slips out of his room and hurries down hall

someone thrusts his cell at ear
the screen splits down the middle on the left we watch the mysterious mans lips
on the right the phone at ear
the boy slumps on his knees his hand limp in his lap his heave
leaning back his jaw distends in a roar
someone drops the phone and staggers back someone collapses on dirt
someone picks up his phone and puts it to ear
the welldressed man ends call

from above we drift down toward the boy as a wind blows a drift of sand over the ground nearby someone angrily kicks the suvs door shut someone lies motionless his brow knitted as his breath comes in shallow gasps light fills view
at the hospital someones head back
blinking confusedly he gives it shake
stepping outside he pauses and massages his palm
someone looks around and glimpses someone hurrying alongside the building he staggers down the steps clutching his abdomen peeking around the corner he finds someone moving through a parking lot with affected nonchalance she pauses by a car checking its doors they dont budge moving on to the car beside it she turns someone darts back behind wall

he blinks and around
his hand finds his seat belt buckle and pushes the button
someone tumbles down and wrestles his way past the thug
as he crawls from the wrecked suv the thug grabs ankle
someone tugs himself free and away
we spy flames spreading over the undercarriage as someone and his brutish henchman escape leaving the heavyset thug stuck in his doorway

now the flatbed truck speeds down a dark stretch of road inside someones closed eyes flutter we glimpse ghost skull
someone wakes with a jolt he massages his palm and someone
now two bodyguards flank a man in a tacky suit as he heads up a winding stone stairway camera flashes erupt around him as he ends a call on his cellphone he heads up another flight of stone steps to a crowded warehouse floor where two men face off on a platform

someone begins to change as he races through the warehouses abandoned rooms a thug charges and he shoves the man away setting him on fire with flames now dancing on his arms someone rushes outside he sees his motorcycle surrounded in billowing fire waiting for him at the end of an alley now he rides alternately cringing and grinning crazily as his face morphs from his human form to the ghost rider and again
his nose and eyes take skull form and he blows fire from his nostrils cringing he reverts to a human face he struggles to remain composed half of his face morphs again flames lick his cheek and burst from his socket
his motorcycles billowing fire rises and engulfs him now in the quarry our view sweeps down a hulking bucket chain excavators giant cutting wheel a caravan of suvs drives under the machines long truss boom followed by a pair of cargo trucks as the last truck passes under a man climbs a ladder to the excavators control cab which sits just behind the cutting wheel at the booms opposite end armed guards keep watch on a balcony on the excavators base structure the trucks pull into an area surrounded by towering stacks of shipping containers a bearded man exits an suv and his men carry out two crates
he hands one of his men the missile launcher
he ignites lighter
he blows out flame
the bearded supplier turns to guards
he smiles disbelievingly at someone now in a room

she cuts the restraints tying him to a support beam then helps up
as she supports him the brutish henchman appears she flips open her knife but he twists her around and dips her as if for a kiss then hurls her to the floor he extended his guns telescopic handle someone and someone share a glance
all three of them lift their skyward
outside someone glances around the brutish frowns
someone throws her knife at him but he catches it as he turns to her with a smile she him
outside smirks
he beckons the bearded supplier who hurries over with the missile launcher they move to the edge of quarry
a man hands the launching tube to someone lifting it onto his shoulder the wavy haired criminal peers through its thermal sight and finds ghost riders glowing image as he speeds along the cliff above the quarry he fires and the missile arcs high into air
as ghost rider speeds down into the quarry the missile dives at him explodes
a mushroom cloud of flames billows into air
the bearded suppliers grin fades following his gaze someone finds ghost rider unharmed standing at the outskirts
he away
as ghost rider advances on a line of guards they fire their assault rifles he whips his chain at three of them and they disintegrate into flames and ash he whirls the chain above his head then strikes another dropping his gun a guard races away ghost rider whips him in half as another guard pulls the pin on a grenade ghost rider whips him and the grenade drops ghost rider stares it
the guards turn from the explosions blinding light as it fades they see ghost riders horizontal body rotating three feet above the ground the men aim their guns ghost rider looks at one who flinches now on his feet ghost rider him
the guard shoots into ghost riders open mouth the flaming skeleton waits as bullets fly in the man lowers his gun and ghost riders head slumps he bellows a stream of flaming bullets at guard
someone shoulders the launcher
through its sight he sees ghost rider approaching as the flaming skeleton knocks him onto back
someone fires the launcher aimed right him
the missile drives him high into the sky in midair the missile extinguishes ghost riders flames then propels him to ground
a brilliant fire cloud billows high into the sky ghost riders smoldering hand reaches out of the fiery crater behind
ghost riders gaze shifts from the excavators giant wheel to the control cab on the boom as guards shoot at him the leather clad skeleton rises to feet
his skull charred and smoking as shots pierce his chest the bullet holes glow he starts to climb the ladder to the control cab then pauses and turns to someone who gawks he resumes climbing while a mass of guards unleashes a barrage of bullets now inside the cab ghost rider shoots flames from his skull shattering the windows
fire billows down the excavators boom and bursts around its wheel
sitting in the control seat between two levers he pulls one back and pushes the forward
the flaming boom around
shifting the levers he raises the wheel high into the air then smashes it onto a watchtower he lifts the flaming wheel again then heaves both levers forward with a grin
the wheel crashes down on a trailer from a balcony someone and someone watch with wide eyes as the wheel slams a truck and some shipping containers then grabs them with the toothy ridges along its perimeter the spinning wheel catapults a piece of flaming metal into sky
someone drags away
the bearded supplier readies a launcher then spots the wheel him
ghost rider shifts the levers and the wheel down
it crushes the supplier in a burst of flames which sends someone flying back the wavy haired man stands blood dripping from mouth
someone helps someone down a flight of stairs someone draws a gun as he aims it at them ghost riders chain wraps around his ankle it yanks him off his feet then drags him to the flaming skeleton ghost rider lifts him off ground
someone drives off with someone in the truck
as someone struggles in ghost riders grip the flaming skeleton hurls him away then gazes into the distance he heads off in the truck someone gives an look
someone shoots him a fearful glance in the rearview mirror she sees ghost rider closing in on motorcycle
she looks over her shoulder at him but finds no one as she turns back she sees him beside her he her
pulling her out through the drivers side window he dismounts his motorcycle and grips her by the arms nearby the truck rolls to a stop someones feet dangle a few inches from ground
someone climbs out of truck
someones eyes widen as the rider gazes them
he looks back someone
under the boys steady stare he releases someone as he heads toward someone his flames fade
he stumbles back a few steps then continues toward someone who holds his ground the fire dancing around his skull dims in a billow of smoke and ghost rider staggers swatting at it he shakes himself out of the daze with his gaze fixed on the boy he trudges closer stopping a few feet away as inky smoke swirls around him someone watches the smoke ringed skeleton drop to knee
the flames on his skull subside and he holds his hands in front of his face as if to protect it the smoke dissipates leaving someone in a kneeling position he around
he lifts his gaze to boy
at a truck stop diner someone sits alone at a booth with a frown his eyes fixed on a family
he sees the father ruffle his hair
approaching from behind with a tray of food someone stops and follows someones gaze he watches the father affectionately touch his sons head then glances back someone
sitting across from him he slides the over
he glances at the family then reaches out and touches someones hair the recoils
someone sullenly
tilting his head someone him
someone gives an look
someone quirks a smile someone them
sitting beside someone she wraps an arm around him and kisses head
she gives a critical look as she sees someone lift a water pitcher and drink it
he obliviously
he flashes a grin at them then drinking
he drinks some more and someone nods someone glances her
he clears the inside of his cheek with his tongue then takes drink
now at the quarry emergency workers tend to the destruction someone lies unconscious under a cement slab approaches
subtitles appear as speaks
his expression becomes flat and he stares lifelessly
lowering himself to his knees someone slides his hand between someone and the cement slab he presses someones chest and the dead mans open
his stutter
the left side of someones face becomes withered wrinkled
and blood vessels burst in eye
splotches of sores appear on skin
someones body trembles as his dark hair morphs blonde
he withdraws under the slab
grabbing the slab someone it
he tosses it aside to expose someone who now has straight shoulderlength platinum hair and skin
the resurrected man scrambles on his hands and knees in the dirt then glances around he rises to his feet and eyes his hands
someone tosses him a smoldering piece wood
it rots in hand
he stares at someone with a gaze
glancing over his shoulder someone sees an emt standing at an ambulances open door
someone follows his lackeys gaze as they stare the emt furrows his brow and takes a back
he shifts his perplexed eyes as he turns around darkness engulfs him someone grabs head
he presses a hand to the mans face which becomes dark with flesh
smiling someone watches as someones touch decays the emts body until it apart
someone gazes steadily at lackey
later someone works on his bike as he and someone ride on the flatbad
someone shakes head
he jumps up to feet
as someone mimes urinating someone imagines ghost rider shooting out a powerful stream fire
he pictures the skeleton nodding him
someone glances at the passing landscape his face becoming somber someone sits him
he eyes boy
someone meets his gaze with a look
he bows head
riding a motorbike someone catches up them
he pulls up to the drivers window
grinning he speeds ahead of truck
someone mimes firing her gun with fingers
now the rear wheel of someones motorcycle burns rubber as it races past the tow truck trailing a billow smoke
it pulls up beside then passes someone who shakes his head at someone the boy sits in front of someone on the gas tank with his legs draped over handlebars
someone sets a bent knee at the rear of his seat then straightens it pushing his weight onto his foot
popping a wheelie they glide along on only the bikes wheel
watching from the truck someone smiles someone shifts his motorcycle onto only its wheel
as the bike comes to a full stop its rear wheels stay up in the air for a moment then drops back to ground
the tow truck cruises past now someones motorcycle catches up to someone again meanwhile the hijacked ambulance glides down an otherwise vacant road through landscape
driving it someone reaches into a lunch box on the seat him
he pulls out a sandwich it grows moldy and disintegrates at his gloved touch glancing into the lunch box he takes out an apple and watches the bright green fruit turn grey crumble
he rubs his gloved fingers against each other cleaning the dust them
he finds a plastic wrapped twinkie and examines it then gives it squeeze
the top of the wrapper pops open and the end of the spongy creamfilled yellow cake out
someone bites into the still fresh snack and thoughtfully
he shoves half of the remaining sheathed twinkie into his mouth then bites down on the wrapper using his teeth to hold the cake in place he slides the wrapper out its now empty plastic smeared cream
later in the desert someone leads someone someone and someone along a path between jutting cliffs and barren mountains with openings
they approach towering rock formations that appear constructed into creating buildings within their structures
someone around
he sees some monks
a group of monks them
the one in front removes his hood revealing tattooed writing covering his face and bald scalp he places a hand on head
someones fingers caress the cross hanging around neck
the monk glances at someone who gives an nod
they embrace then switch sides and embrace again someone notices more monks surrounding group
the tattoo faced monk shifts his intense gaze to someone who lifts chin
the monk twitches a smile
someone turns to companion
he winks someone
he moves to side
someone gives an uncertain look as she and someone start off with monks
a monk reaches him
someone kneels in front him
he touches cheek
someone guides her dejected away
someone aside
now they walk through a vast cellar
someone grabs a bottle from a table in the middle of rotunda
he takes swig
he heavenward
our view ascends to find an angel spreading its wings over earth
the angels eyes bulge glimpsing a barrage of images war money riots napalm a woman
someone looks at someone and grins he leaves a wall of cubby holes stocked wine
fire engulfs a skeleton
someone lowers his gaze
someone grins then wraps his arm around friend
at a cubby hole he takes out an ancient bottle of wine
he kisses the bottle then looks someone
he walks off and someone thoughtfully
he puts the cross around his neck in someones hand and looks him in eyes
someone shifts his gaze someone grabs the possessed mans shoulder and they down
holding the cross someone looks into the eyes
daylight shines down on them from a hole in ceiling
he wipes a tear from eye
someone turns to his bag and takes out a small loaf bread
he breaks it half
he puts one back
he breaks off a piece someone
someone takes it him
he takes a bite then shifts gaze
someone pats him on shoulder
now someone wanders through tunnel
he reaches the end of the passage and a huge slab blocks him from turning back he enters an room
our view whirls glimpsing numerous passageways someone looks up at the rooms ceiling
a brilliant light flashes then shines down on him he collapses to knees
he rolls on his back his eyes morphing into sockets
as he convulses the distorts
as he grimaces his memories move in reverse his blood lifts from the contract and the broken reforms
as someone arched his back in pain we see him as a flameless ghost rider falling through a void
he drops into the distance his arms and flailing
he shoots a seemingly endless length of chain from his mouth as it pulls taut it breaks from his skull with a flash
his skull emits a flow of smoke distorting his structure
cut black
now on the floor of the empty room someone lies flat on his back with his closed
our view draws near the side of face
he wakes with a start and rises to a crouch then looks at his gloved right hand gives it a rub brightens
he hurries through one of passages
he runs another
he reaches the mouth of cavern
he heads down a stairway carved into stone
the path leads him to bluff overlooking region
he shifts gaze
someone hurries off he enters a hall
he finds the monks detaining someone someone someone
a monk seizes arm
someone falls to his knees his gloved trembling
someone swipes at another monk with his free hand but the monk grabs throat
the tattoo faced monk someone
he runs the backs of his fingers down her cheek then jams his thumb just below her chin knocking her unconscious someone on
take them away until the thing done
the monks drag someone and out
the tattoo faced monk off
outside the hooded monks stand in circle
two more bring someone to the center and bend him over rock
the tattooed monk follows a monk pulls back the nervous boys collar the others sway side side
the tattoo faced monk draws a sword and taps its long curved blade to the back of neck
with both hands the executioner raises the overhead
he finds himself surrounded by darkness then twirls his defensively
as another monk gropes in the dark someone grabs him from behind rip him and lets fall
he runs to another and throws down
the tattoo faced monk spots someone leaping from his victim someone snaps a decaying monks neck he grabs another from behind the tattoo faced monk swings his sword someone catches his wrist then vanishes as the tattoo faced monk looks for him someone grabs the swords hilt causing its blade to rust and crumble the monk grabs someones throat and he collapses to his knees waving his hands surrender
the monk lets go his decomposing
someone smashes the monks hand grabs his jaw then slams him onto his back sneering at his victim he holds two fingers over the monks tattooed face the monks bald head withers his skin crumpling as he rots completely someone holds up his fingers
in the light of day someone watches someone jump back from his kill he glances at the surrounding bodies of the other monks each petrified in frightful poses the boy steps nervously
someone eyes him stroking his hair
now as we rove over the craggy landscape glaring sunlight overtakes view
then shrinks to a pinpoint as we drift among two petrified monks left permanently kneeling prayer
as a butterfly lands on a sprouting mushroom the image focuses on a moss monk
crouching over one of the dead someone picks up his cross necklace she looks someone
someone them
he off
someone shifts her worried gaze someone nods for her follow
now we soar over the ruins of the demolished structure overgrown with weeds uzak turkey
an ambulance pulls up to the archways of an ancient amphitheaters wall
black clad guards surround building
someone walks out followed by two of his men
someone steps out of the ambulance and shuts the door
someone opens the ambulances door
he pulls out someone bound to stretcher
someone strolls over as his guards untie boy
someone him
someones diminishes
someone chuckles himself
now someone leads someone and someone through passage
he brings them to a armory
someone peers through scope
she takes the sniper rifle in a corridor someone sits someone
the boy gazes up him
someone envisions ghost rider urinating fire from left right
he over
he sits up straight and nods
someone meets his gaze
someone forward
someone nods for one of guards to bring him a case
he takes out a syringe then turns to son
as a guard restrains the boy someone injects someone through neck
someone smiles as the child loses consciousness he upright
he returns the syringe to case
now someone and someone follow someone climbing to the top of an structure
which overlooks the amphitheater in the surrounding ruins someone peers through a binocular spying on arriving guests someone takes knee
they watch the guests outside
at dusk above the darkened horizon scattered clouds roll across sky
at night spotlights illuminate the ancient amphitheater as someones guards walk someone out stage
the guards leave the boy kneeling before the guests who sit in six uniform sections all wearing robes
someone faces his acolytes then raises both arms gesturing for them to rise from seats
someone lowers his arms and sets his maniacal gaze on someone who remains on his knees rocking side to side with his down
meanwhile the cross hairs of a night vision sniper scope move from one guard to next
someone lowers her worried gaze sets down her rifle and off
as someone follows her someone returns his gaze to the amphitheater and knocks on a wall
someone follows someone out among ruins
he lays his hand on her shoulder and she meets his gaze anxiously
someone her
he rests his hand on shoulder
she glances down then heads off and he turns to watch go
now a half moon shines in the sky
someones black robed acolytes sway as chant
on stage someone kneels a few feet away someone
both swaying in unison as though under a spell we glimpse a few chanting mouths meanwhile the sniper scope targets guard
collapses
another down
someone reloads and takes aim at third
she glances up from her green tinted night vision scope then spots four men in brawl
she glances up once more then recognizes someone and someone as they leave their fallen behind
now someone leads someone past a wall he peeks around a corner then crouches with partner
he takes a swig of 2000 year wine
he hands the bottle to someone who takes a sip well
someone hands back
someone kisses his friend on cheek
grins
he grabs his bag and leaves someone heads off as well now someone reaches an entryway and chugs wine
two guards trade look
he tosses the bottle and shoots them down
he kicks guard
he reloads then runs up staircase
now someone darts furtively through a passage in amphitheater
he hurdles the low edge of a stone window and peers around column
he finds someone and someone swaying on their knees before the acolytes
someone and someone forward
the boy raises his head his eyes bloodshot with irises
someone opens his black bloodshot eyes someone creeps closer and shakes his head wrathfully someones move
someone chants as well his acolytes tilt their back
gazing down on the stage we find a shadow extending from someones body as if reaching someone
someone runs out in stands
he shoots down guard
someone turns and looks up his eyes returning to normal as he watches someone shooting his guards and acolytes someone runs onto the stage and punches out
someone runs through the stands shooting more acolytes he pauses spreading his arms exultantly someone reaches a gloved hand out someone
an unseen force it
someone stares coldly at someone through blackened eyes someone tries again to reach for him but stops his neck crooking convulsively in the stands someone arrives and grabs someones gun hand his glove and decay
someone up
with a swipe of his hand he sends someone flying off the stage he lands hard in a gravel pit below in a ring of darkness someone decays the priests right arm in grasp
the right side of someones head decomposes as he swings his left fist at the demon someone catches it easily and forces down
someone them
darkness closes in around the priest as someones grasp him
his back arches as the demon snarls his face a mess of rotten flesh someone smashes his head against someones someone looks on as someone shakes the rot off his face and out of his hair mouth
someone and someone watch the acolytes surround someone who struggles to stand in the pit
someones hand creeps over his shoulder bringing him back to knees
he brings the other hand around to his cheek and holds him by the head as someone looks on with a bitter twisted scowl someone draws a line of decay across someones high forehead the devil turns and his minion looks up the acolytes somberly part to reveal someone walking toward someone and the someone
the demon wrenches his victims head to face the boy then grins someone
the devil eagerly
the boy regards him with a brow
someone kneels on one knee with the other leg crooked out awkwardly someone someone
someone gives a scowl
someone returns his somber gaze someone
he looks back and forth between the boy and his father
he remember smashing the bottle with his fist and the contract pages flipping by themselves someone gives a defeated nod as he recalls signing the contract with his blood he looks up someone
someone bares his gritted teeth someone runs up to him seizes him by the shoulders and spews a jet of fire him
someone releases his victim and staggers back looking on the flames jetting from someones mouth engulf someones face the cursed man accepts the fire with a wide mouth
falling back someone lies motionless on gravel
on his feet someone staggers around as black smoke plumes from his head the surrounding acolytes recoil as he draws near his face a swirl of flames staring slack jawed someone darts away as someone halts and doubles over the acolytes him
someone helps someone
at her post someone turns to find someones motorcycle erupting flames as the engine starts itself
in the gravel pit the acolytes close in on someone in the sky a rising sun breaks over a rapid swirl of clouds ghost rider rises taking out the acolytes with a circular sweep of his red hot chain all around the amphitheater posted floodlights explode outside someone loads a limp someone into an suv armed men in full body armor rush to surrounding suvs and trucks someones vehicle speeds away followed by the armed convoy in the gravel pit ghost rider jerks his head side side
he stares at his own hands
his skeleton head snaps to one side attentively and he marches off in someones suv someones head slumps forward his father regards him with a bitter scowl as he leads the convoy at high speed away from ruins meanwhile ghost rider marches from the amphitheater to find his flaming motorcycle approaching it skids to a half before and he on
the rider speeds off his chopper trailing thick plumes of smoke
now someones convoy travels through a desert on an isolated highway
ghost rider quickly gains on trucks
the rear driver spots him and swerves left blocking his path the rider deftly weaves around the truck a gunman ahead fires rounds from a mounted cannon they blast holes in the asphalt around the flaming motorcycle but fail to impede it at the lead someone spies the rider in his side mirror and resentfully
ghost rider pulls up beside a ruthless truck as its driver barks into radio
he leaps from his motorcycle onto to the drivers side of the cab and shrieks in his face the driver flies from the truck landing in the dirt ghost rider leaps onto the drivers seat and takes the wheel flames erupt throughout the engine and blaze around tires
meanwhile someone drives after the convoy in a dusty suv her chin lowered in a determined stare at the wheel of the flaming truck the rider thrusts one hand out to the side and gives a taunting shriek the cannon truck swerves before it the shooter firing relentlessly ghost rider rear ends it and it explodes the suv ahead of it spins out of control threatening to cut someone
she weaves around it without breaking speed from below someone climbs up on her hood crouching playfully he touches a fingertip to her windshield a weblike network of cracks spreads across the glass he drives his fist through the cracks shattering the windshield someone shields her face from the flying glass shards ahead an suv carrying gunmen pulls up beside ghost riders truck the flaming vehicle knocks it off the road the rider turns behind him someone reaches a hand someone
ghost rider slings his chain someone lurches with a tug the rider yanks him off someones hood and onto the bed of his possessed truck someone grabs the chains which start to rot in grasp
his smug grin vanishes the rider tugs the chain pulling him down and leaps over him recovering someone grabs him behind
the rider elbows him then knocks back
his chain rises by itself winding around demon
someone dances away from it and meets the rider in a hold
the mad angel leaps from the bed and together they fly through darkness twin lights flare them
theyre someones headlights the grappling foes land on her suvs hood someone head butts the rider who punches him the demon rolls over on top of him but the angel throws him into the air as someone lands back on the hood his foe flings him off the rider peers toward the road looking for his enemy someone climbs up the suvs rear and over the roof the foes reconverge in a wrestling grasp on the hood shifting gears someone accelerates and rear ends an suv knocking it off the road someone bends the rider over the side of hood
darkness fills the sky and ghost riders flames weakly
his flames reignite in a wild blaze as he lifts his skull he seizes someone by the head and brings his face close his jaw opening wide his cocky smirk gone someone stares fearfully through glistening bloodshot eyes the riders flames catch on his long stringy hair the vengeful creature flings someone to the road where he instantly
ghost riders skull snaps around catching sight of someones suv ahead his flaming motorcycle pulls up alongside someones vehicle then creeps ahead the gypsy woman shifts gears and accelerates ghost rider leaps from her hood landing on his motorcycle its thick trails of black smoke obscure our view as we follow him up the highway someones side mirrors show ghost gaining
as he draws closer he slings his glowing chain forward it lashes around the undercarriages central rod ghost rider gives his chain tug
someone lurches and the auto part flies past rider
the suv swerves off the road then flips end end
it lands on its roof in a wreck
ghost rider pulls up beside it dismounts from his motorcycle and marches toward the vehicle with a steady gait
he finds someone crawling laboriously from wreck
his aging wounded vessel limp from the chest down the devil drags himself across sand
ghost riders gloved hand snatches him by the shoulder then hauls him to feet
someones twisted features scowl bitterly as the rider shrieks in face
ghost rider throws him down then slings him skyward with a chain around his chest someone hovers helplessly in his bonds high above earth
the rider snaps the chains slinging the devil into ground
our view zooms down the chain to a seemingly pit
following the chain we find someone plunging into a sea fire
his limbs flailing he steers helplessly as the flames eat away at flesh
the hell fires flare their light overwhelming view
in the light of a high bright sun ghost rider crosses his arms over his chest he spreads them wide lifting his palms and skeleton face exultingly toward the heavens he sways side to side his fleshless mouth working in a roar
ghost rider doubles over then arches back triumphantly he slumps forward and lingers stillness
he turns head
several yards away someone crests a ridge at run
she lurches to halt at the sight of ghost rider standing beside the overturned suv
the creatures skull turns toward the wreckage as someone watches ghost rider circles the vehicle down
halts
he glances back toward someone and lowers his again
his gloved hands reach out uncertainly and he lowers out of view someone wavers on her feet her breath coming in ragged gasps she steps forward as ghost rider stands cradling someones limp form in arms
ghost rider carries the boy to mother
someone staggers woefully as he nears then sinks to knees
the rider bends down laying someone in arms
she tilts the boys head gently
someone raises a skeletal hand enveloped in flames
someone eyes uncertainly
someone extends his mystical burning skeletal hand someone
someone crosses a protective arm over son
reaching past it someone caresses the cheek

he produces a bow arrow

grins
his eyes roll back and faints
he jogs up a corridor then kicks open a coal door and slides down a chute
at the bottom he runs past damp brick walls then scurries through a labyrinth of pipes machinery
he ducks through a large gear with thick spokes then races up a staircase
turning down another narrow hallway with steam rising through the grating the boy reaches another clock powered by a complex mechanism of gears
he peers through the clocks open numbers at a toy shop below surrounded by dolls rocking horses musical instruments and other items a bearded whitehaired man sits behind the counter with his chin propped on hand
the man glances sideways and narrows his eyes as he studies clock
the boy stares back through the four
the man releases a windup mouse watches it scoot across counter
then it
a brownhaired girl wearing a beret steps up beside the man and sets down a loaf bread
he gestures towards the back of shop
the girl stands and smiles at the man looking at her he shrugs then emphatically
slowly she turns and walks away with the bread the boy watches as the man lowers his head and shuts eyes
his hands rest on the counter a few inches from the windup mouse crouching the boy leaves the clock and scuttles along a crawlspace beneath walkway
he swings open a small metal grate then steps into a tiled corridor opposite shop
confiserie et juet or candy and shop
wearing a tattered coat shorts and sweater the boy creeps toward store
the whitehaired man dozes behind the counter as the boy reaches the toy shop he reaches one hand toward the mouse
the man suddenly snatches arm
the mouse falls breaks
the boy reaches into his coat pocket then sets items onto the counter a pocketknife bundle of string and a piece of cloth filled with small sprockets gears springs
the boy glances over his shoulder then reaches into his other pocket glaring at the man he takes out a small notebook and slaps it onto counter
the man releases the boys arm then opens notebook
he frowns as he flips through pages
handwritten notes mathematical equations and schematic drawings fill pages
the man inhales sharply as he flips to drawings of a mechanical mans head torso
the shopkeeper squeezes his eyes shut as he rapidly flips the pages the drawings become an animation of the automaton turning head
the man shakes the notebook in the boys face then frowns and slaps it onto counter
across the station the station inspector lifts head
the station inspector removes the leash from his dog who then runs off the inspector limps through the crowd him
the dog skids across the polished floor as he runs up the hallway opposite the toyshop the boy spins around then takes off into crowd
swinging out his unbending left leg as he runs the inspector follows them
he slams into a woman spins then falls on top of her the fivepiece band plays in the cafe as the boy leaps over a bench and upsets a table
the boy zips through the cafe then weaves his way through tables front
a woman clutches a small little dog to her chest as the doberman skids past a large tiered cake races past the band then runs out of the other side of the cafe the station inspector dashes into cafe
hurtling toward the cake the inspector turns and crashes into the band he puts his foot through a bass guitar and falls into the band members the inspector struggles to feet
gripping a someone club the inspector runs out the other end of cafe
up ahead the boy dashes through the crowd then slides under a newspaper legs
the inspector shoves past the man then pushes his way into a throng of travelers standing on a platform
he limps up the platform along the edge of the tracks pushing people out of the way as goes
the inspector reaches the end of the platform and gazes himself
his dog paces in a circle above them the boy paces along a narrow catwalk running across the tracks as a train leaves station
the inspector throws down club
the passing train snags the inspectors brace
he falls and the train drags him along platform
he slides into a suitcase which strikes him in the crotch the dog lies down and lowers his head meanwhile the boy jogs up a grimy corridor filled with gears and steaming pipes he crawls through a gap in a mesh screen then hops through the spokes of a large gear as it spins the boy turns down a hallway then opens a door
he inside
reaching into a pocket the boy takes out a set of keys as he approaches another door
he slides a latch then shoves open the door
the boy enters an attic with a woodplank floor and shuts the door him
light shines in through narrow windows along the slanted ceiling and illuminates spinning gears and exposed girders
the boy crosses to a small area in front of three large windows which has been clean
he steps to a worktable covered in gears sprockets and drawings
he picks up one gear and compares it to drawing
then tosses aside
setting his jaw the leaves
he climbs down a metal ladder to a large square clock suspended over train platforms
inside the boy attaches a handle to the clockwork mechanism and it
he oils a gear then stares down at the below
outside the cafe the brownhaired woman still holds her little dog to chest
the news vendor a rotund man wearing glasses and a beret approaches woman
she nods and the man reaches his hand toward dog
the smiles
later he trudges up a metal staircase inside a square tower clouds of steam rise up the lofty tower and drift past an enormous pendulum swinging back forth
at the top large clocks face out from every side each controlled by a single mechanism with immense gears inching around some stray pigeons the boy climbs a stepladder beside the mechanism and switches on a lightbulb hanging from chain
he cranks a thick handle protruding from the side of mechanism
stopping his efforts the boy gazes out the center of a face
the sun sets behind the eiffel tower in distance
slowly he creeps forward and stares out through the glass
he stands motionless at the top of the clock tower as the setting sun casts long shadows over the train station and the rest of the city
the whitehaired man pulls down a gate as he closes shop
the man turns and faces boy
the man off
someone stares after him then follows through the mostly deserted station
someone strides closer as they reach the entrance
the shopkeeper turns his back on someone and out
someone stands rooted to the floor gazing out at the snowy paris beyond
someone throws open the doors and outside
shivering against the cold someone follows several paces behind the shopkeeper as he crosses a wide street
someone rubs his hands together as the man trudges up stone steps then turns down a street lined with tenements
the twin towers of notre dame loom in distance
someone glances over his shoulder as he trails the man into alley
hurrying his pace he falls in step beside the man who doesnt acknowledge presence
they approach a gate leading to a cemetery filled with snow dusted statues of hooded figures standing with their hands clasped and their bowed
someone stares up at the statues as passes
the man walks out of a gate on the opposite side then enters a buildings front door which he shuts in face
someone furrows brow
he steps back and stares up at the building as a train passes along an elevated nearby
the girl who visited the shopkeeper earlier is visible in an window
in the window beside it the shopkeeper steps beside a woman
someone tosses a pebble at the window
she stands and looks down him
someone motions for her to come outside then presses his palms together pleads
frowning the girl glances over shoulder
a moment later she opens the front door and outside
the girl stares at someone with her crossed
she steps him
someone plants his feet and folds arms
smiling the nods
someone nods back then turns and runs through the cemetery
back in the attic someone lights a candle and sets it onto a seat
he turns and yanks a sheet off a dollsized mechanical man or automaton sitting at a table
the automatons head and hands solid
while its arms and torso are an open framework
gears and sprockets fill the automatons cavity
someone sits across from the automaton and stares at its solid eyes
as the light flickers clothes materialize on the man
now well dressed and clean someone stands with a blonde man glasses
the man sets a small table in front of automaton
someones father opens the automatons shirt and exposes its mechanism
someones father shrugs then smiles and him
someone watches his father place a gear assembly into the chest
later his father repairs a clock in his shop which is filled with various gears mechanisms
someone nearby
at night his father runs a finger over a heartshaped keyhole in the back
he flips through his notebook to a page with drawings of a key
someone watches him add sketch
back in the train station tears well in eyes
in a museum someones father furrows his brow as he studies a mechanical model of a large sphere with satellites
standing by a rotating film reel he glances back over his shoulder frowns
someones father walks through museum
passing a sarcophagus adorned with the figure of pope
he steps slowly past marble statues and other works of antiquity and gazes at a pair of doors
as he throws open the doors flames twist up a staircase and him
back in the shop someone polishes the automaton with a strip cloth
a mustached man wearing a bowler staggers into room
claude takes a drag from his cigarette burns his finger and it
someone stares at his uncle then lowers eyes
someones eyes flip from side to side as he downward
someone recoils as claude sways into a clock
claude palms a nearby pocket watch and places it into coat
later someone carries automaton
claude takes a swig from a flask as he leads someone to station
they walk into the storeroom
someone unwraps automaton
claude and someone visit a site
alone with the automaton someone blinks tears
in the station the brownhaired woman walks her little dog to the cafe and opens door
someone peers through the vent at a tray of croissants
the news vendor smiles as he approaches the woman and dog
as he offers the woman a paper her dog him
her dog pulls her away from cafe
as station agents rush to her aide someone sneaks out of the vent and creeps toward the tray croissants
glancing around himself he steals a roll and a bottle of milk then off
wearing his leg brace the station inspector paces down a staircase and surveys crowd
he leans back against pillar
still chewing someone stands on the other side of pillar
he freezes as the inspector takes out a pocket watch and checks time
someone ducks as the inspector stretches back his arms then hides behind the pillar as the inspector turns head
someone flees in the direction
nearby the brownhaired flower seller smiles as she pushes her cart through station
straightening his hat the inspector walks stiffly towards the woman as she sets shop
grimacing the inspector reaches down and unlocks his brace
he glances toward the flower seller then turns and limps off in the direction
meanwhile someone opens toyshop
he turns and someone
staring at someone someone steps forward and hands him a small parcel wrapped cloth
as someone opens it ashes and flakes of charred paper spill onto floor
sobs shake shoulders
he looks up someone
with tears streaming down cheeks
someone presses his together
then jerks his head to side
someone wipes his face with a sooty hand then off

someone narrows eyes
without glancing away from the boy he reaches under the counter then drops the broken windup mouse in front someone
someone looks down then back someone
someone remains standing with his arms at sides
someone sets down a cup of small hand tools then folds arms
stepping forward someone picks up a screwdriver and adjusts the toys mechanism
he takes off the toy outer shell and uses a small hammer to pound it back shape
he snaps the shell back onto mechanism
tightens it on with screws then places the repaired mouse back onto counter
someone picks up the mouse inserts a key and winds up
the mouse scuttles over the counter in a figureeight rears up on a spring and peers at someone forms another figureeight and peers someone
then still
someone waves his dismissively
someone walks into the shop then reaches for broom
in the cafe a musician with a pencilthin moustache strums a guitar in front of band
people dance or tap their toes as clouds of cigarette smoke fill air
in the toy store someone squirts oil onto a house
people dancing
he glances up at someone who holds a deck of playing cards topped by the eight spades
as he waves one hand the eight of diamonds rises from the middle of deck
someone glances at someone who quickly returns to work
someone shuffles the cards as he stares at boy
later he demonstrates how to fan out a deck cards
someone attempts it with a deck of his own but fumbles and drops cards
alone in the attic kneeling across from the automaton someone waves one hand over a deck cards
the king of hearts card floats up into hand
he presents it to automaton
grins
in the shop he paints coat buttons onto a soldier
in the steamy attic he reattaches the automatons arm
in the shop someone looks up from his work at someone who demonstrates dance steps for a group girls
in the attic he pushes a mechanisms gear with his thumb spinning a propeller
in the main station someone stares at her feet as she dances with another girl she looks up and smiles at someone who gasps and away
in the attic someone inserts the repaired mechanism into the automatons chest cavity and locks it place
later the reassembled automaton sits at the small table with a sheet of blank paper and a pen in its hand
someone winds a crank on the back
smiling someone leaps in front of the automaton watches
a few more gears within the complicated mechanism begin spin
the automaton motionless
the pen in its hand moving
someones fades
he steps forward and lightly shoves the automaton then flicks the propeller
he forces it to turn but still happens
someone walks to the back of the automaton and rubs one finger over the heart keyhole
someone pulls off a thin metal rod and drops it onto worktable
in the train station a dirty boy with ratty hair and clothing glances at someone as he strolls past toyshop
holding his dog on a leash the station inspector stares intently at the boy as he him
someone ducks behind the toyshop counter until pass
a businessman reading a newspaper vacates a bench leaving behind a crumpled bag
the unwashed boy examines the contents of the bag then peers into an empty bottle
the station inspector steps up him
the boy tries to run but the dog blocks his retreat the inspector whips the leash around the ankle
the boy now stands in a cage in the office
someone peers down from a clock
someone watches the boy being lead to a policemans wagon
the boy struggles but they toss him into the wagon with a group of orphans
the policeman gives the inspector photo
someone scurries to another vent and watches someone give lessons
later someone explores the bookstore someone
someone stares at someone then smiles and takes his hand as they walk around a giant stack books

someone back
later they stand in a street gazing up at a glowing theatre sign cinema
someone glances at someone then jerks his head to side
they tiptoe around the corner together to a entrance
taking out a set of small tools someone picks lock
he opens the door inside the darkened theatre someone and someone together
on the movie screen harold someone dangles from the side of a building by fingertips
he regains his footing and climbs up the corner of building
someone glances sideways at someone smiles
as someone slips someone gasps and grabs arm
someone stands on a ledge
in an apartment a man swings out the bottom of his window forcing someone to grab onto the hands of a clock
the clock face starts to detach from building
someones legs kick wildly as he hangs by only a springs
a mustached man sneaks up behind someone and someone and grabs shoulders
he wrestles them out of their seats and marches them out of the door
someone and someone flee up sidewalk
standing on a bridge someone stares her
he takes a step forward then turns and points into distance

leaving the building someone steps out onto a street crowded pedestrians
posted cameras monitor neighborhood
a little approaches
her clock move
someone holds out a hand she gives him a flat box
he presses its curved receptor to the inside of his wrist a display ticks up to minutes
someone takes the time with smile
turning a corner someone checks his body clock then breaks into run
arriving outside a factory someone goes to a coffee cart with the drink prices listed digitally in minutes and seconds the prices abruptly
someone sticks his wrist in a scanner that takes minutes off timer
opening a flask someone spikes coffee
two men clasp each arms
now an inky black body clock shows all zeros on a dead arm
a welldressed man standing over the corpse meets gaze
as someone moves on someone lingers holding the thin mans gaze with eyes
later he stands at a machine inside factory
someone sets a flat metal box on a platform then pulls lever
as he repeats the process a complete portable time capsule rolls down a conveyor sporting the curved receptor at end
it joins others in bin
now the factory workers file past a scanner each sticking their wrist in as go
heading off someone checks clock
someone marches sullenly
now he arrives at a harshly lit doorway where a sign overhead beerwine
he enters the bar where women in slinky dresses dance before a band
one paws at someone as he passes smiling politely he sidles past and goes to a table where men cards
someone grasps the card forearm
he moves off down the length of the bar passing a chiseled welldressed man flanked by beautiful women someone sits at the end
he points at the man
the welldressed man waves at bartender
nearby a man starring at his exposed body clock hangs up phone
the women paw at the man
clad in dark clothes the stranger glares coldly him
noticing someone approaches the man
the handsome man sips his casually
the door bursts open and a group of thugs saunter in as the bar clears someone sticks by the rich side
a blonde man with a gun leads thugs
someone leads someone to a back hall the rich man stands and faces thugs
as someone leaves someone watches the rich stranger and the minutemen their leader sets his down
his gaze drifts towards the rich clock
the wealthy mans hand curls into fist
he glares at gangster
someone removes overcoat
his smooth ageless features give smirk
the wealthy man takes a few steps forward then shifts his uneasy gaze and loosens tie
someone steps out of view as the man away
the stranger bumps a table then rushes nauseously into the back hall where he pushes his way in to a room
posted nearby a thug in a fedora him
crouching at a toilet the rich vomits
from hiding someone swings a stall door knocking out thug
out front someone spies someone hustling the rich out
in alley
someone blocks the exit with dumpster
he leads the wealthy man down the alley and out onto street
someone and his men leave the bar through the front exit and get in a car
the car pursues someone and the stranger down a street
the two men reach gate
someone boosts the stranger into it
climbing after his companion someone drops down on the other side as the arrives
as someone drags the stranger down an alley the car backs out of view the two men reach a door and someone breaks a chain locking it shut the stranger starts to off
someone yanks him through the doorway then uses the chain to pull the door shut them
the car speeds view
hidden in a shadowy space someone gets a firm grip on the chain the gangsters get out of the car and bang against doorways spaced along the wall
wielding a gun the fedorawearing thug marches up to someones door and kicks lock
as he tugs at it the working man on the other side holds the chain tightly the thug gives up and on
someone leads the rich away
as someone angrily scans the alley someone leads his companion up an stairway
the fedorawearing thug stands behind shoulder
a malicious smile flickers across features
now in a large abandoned space someone shoves the stranger onto a leather bench then crosses to a wall of dirty windows
someone takes out a flask and unscrews cap
he holds it out to his rescuer and insistently
taking it sips
he shuts his eyes and shakes head
someone reluctantly takes swig
he shakes his again
he returns the flask to his companion
someones smile fades as a car crawls outside
smirking someone checks clock
it reads 18 hours minutes
someone faces the rich man with a frown
he stalks closer to someone bitterly
the rich man lowers head
he meets the working class mans knowing gaze as someone turns away someone stares ahead with a expression
someone faces him then sinks into a leather armchair positioned opposite bench
someone blinks quizzically and tilts head
under someones earnest gaze someone blinks heavily and away
the rich man eyes his arm
someone pulls up his sleeve and watches his clock seconds away
someone gives a small nod his glistening
he stares off sadly then meets someones gaze
someone stares at the glowing clock ticking down his own time
they share a brief smile
someone leans forward holding out flask
someone brings it to his lips hesitantly then swigs at it with enthusiasm
he returns the flask to its melancholy owner who tips it in a silent toast drinks
daylight pours in through the windows as someone lies back on the bench his head on the meagerly armrest
facing him someone sleeps in armchair
the rich man wakes and turn toward rescuer
we drift closer to the working class man as he peacefully
his arms dangling over rests
someone creeps over to someone and crouches at side
pulling back sleeve
he slips his own wrist someones
he glances at someone with wide eyes then looks down at his clock
and watches the rapidly count
as he reaches a balance of minutes
someone halts transfer
someone wakes with start
getting his bearings he habitually checks his clock
it reads over years
the working class man looks around finds himself alone and up
facing the windows he stands abruptly and closer
letters written in the grime of a glass read
dont waste time
peering out a broken pane next to it someone spots someone sitting on the railing of a high stone bridge his feet dangling over side
the melancholy man faces the river and distant mountains as his body clock ticks down under seconds
he blinks his clear pale eyes in the bright morning sun and his woeful expression serene
his clock ticks out its last seconds
someones back arches and he painfully
his body falls from the railing tumbles midair and splashes into the shallow water 50 below
someone sprints onto the bridge and peers over railing
the shallow rivers current rushes around someone as he sprawls motionless on its bed
a mounted camera lowers its view towards someone who wearily away
now at an apartment complex a smiling woman cradles baby
she eyes the clock
exiting an apartment he appears at side
someone gives his friend a nod
as he and someone head down a flight of stairs into courtyard
someone unzips the end of his sleeve
glancing around he pulls up
he shows clock
nodding someone looks thoughtfully
a faint smile touches his lips as he turns someone
clasping someones arm he holds gaze
as someone releases him someone checks clock
someone claps a hand on shoulder
someone nods then twitches a smile
someone grabs him into hug
pulling away he gives his friend an look
someone lifts his brow in an expression
and someone off
someone stares after him then checks his again
he glances at a bar across street
now someones mom scans her wrist a sign on the building that reads weis time lenders flashes off as she heads away the windows go dark someones mother boards bus
with a tense look she jerks her hand away from scanner
sliding her sleeve up she checks the balance on clock
the bus driver shifts his regretful away
someones mother looks at the other passengers who either avoid her gaze or turn away with expressions
she hurries off the bus and jogs back towards weis time lenders finding closed
the bus away
someones mother glances around her desperate
then takes off down a street
ahead of her the buss taillights glow in the shadows of buildings
now someones mother furiously pumps her arms as runs
behind her a trucks headlights grow brighter as it closer

finding only 20 minutes on her clock she takes off at sprint
as the bus stops in dayton someone steps forward holding bouquet
two passengers climb off and the doors closed them
someone gazes in at the buss remaining passengers then watches the vehicle away
his thoughtful eyes shift to a truck heading in the opposite direction and he drops his flowers taking off it
meanwhile his mother hurries toward a man entering building
he hurries inside and closes door
banging on the door she sees the man glance back then off
she checks her clock minutes

a concrete barricade blocks path
a metal panel cut in at one side to create a c shaped hollow flips up from a console someone
he slips his wrist into the cufflike scanner and watches his clocks balance down
a green light flashes on booth
and the concrete barricade lowers into the ground allowing the sedan pass

his body covered in a downy comforter
awaking he sits up and around
he checks his clock which shows over years
lying back down he lets his head drop onto the pillow and closes eyes
he opens them again and furrows brow
later a view through the hotel restaurants window shows someone alone
he shoots furtive glances at his surroundings as he devours his fries
the auburnhaired young woman watches him from her table on a outside

the roadster speeds along a winding road built into a cliff face as ocean waves below
at night the roadster turns pulls through an open gate and passes a statue

she gazes longingly toward ocean
now from underwater we gaze up at the silhouetted naked forms of someone and someone as they swim side side
the green light from their body clocks glows in water
they pause near a formation
as they tread water they bring their open mouths close
someone soberly paddles back little
as she maintains her distances calm waves splash them

the spotlight silhouettes them as they move closer and touch foreheads then press their lips together in a gentle kiss
in the audiencepacked house someones smile vanishes she stares at the screen slackjawed then disbelievingly cocks head
the spotlight projects the childrens shadows onto the screen as kiss
a puppeteer lights a sparkler behind the kissing puppets brightening their image within the shadow of the youngsters
someone frowns and someone uncomfortably
now a second sparkler dramatizing the puppets kiss blurs to become sparks thrown by a welding torch in grip
as he works on the car in his living room someone in
someone retreats to the door and stands facing the kung fu master his jacket hangs tied around waist
someone ambles back into room
he unties jacket
later in the courtyard outside dozens of bells dangle from leafy tree branches strings
someone stands facing the utility pole hanging his jacket on peg
he pulls the garment down flings it to the ground then picks it up and whirls it around shoulders
whipping it off he flings it back onto the peg with a grouchy smile
as he continues the routine someone strolls outside with mug

now we soar over an emeraldhued mountain range with conical peaks drifting over a ridge we spy a train winding its way alongside a tranquil muddy river on a crowded passenger car someone gazes out a window at the landscape
mr someone dozes him
someone shifts his gaze
mr someone faces wearily
leaning across someone someone draws a character on the window
as he settles back into his seat his student gazes solemnly at the character chi

water streams past them down the rocks
now a jagged peak looms high above mountains patched snow
our view tilts down to a dizzyingly long stairway us
mr someone marches up the narrow steps followed by student
one section of the stairs rests on a fin rock
barely wider than the itself
they ascend the run
later at another section someone stops leaning against a banister
mr someone continues up without breaking his stride now we drift over an elaborate monastery
rustred walls support ancient roofs
mr someone leads his pupil up onto a small balcony then along a corridor
it leads them into a stone courtyard where dozens of male and female monks in snowy tunics perform chi
with fluid grace they execute the meditative movements in unison
on a balcony a man in a navy tunic rapidly twirls a fighting staff around his lithe frame as mr someone leads someone past the monk crouches on foot
balancing on his staff as he extends his other leg parallel to ground
where two railings make a corner a monk does a split from one to the other and snaps open a fan
someone swallows staring at the feat
venturing onward the boy spies a third monk sitting in the pose
from a pair of twin platforms he pushes himself up by his knuckles balances
now an enclosed walkway stands built into a high cliff face mr someone leads someone inside glancing out the windows as he along
following his gaze the boy halts in tracks
outside a woman in a white tunic faces dropoff
she crouches revealing a cobra poised before her its hood out
slackjawed the boy runs to another window the female ascetic stands on an ornamentalstone jut over the 1000foot drop as she straightens the reptile rises to her
balancing on one foot the woman sweeps an arm in an arc behind her head and holds the other gently crooked her
the disciple tucks her extended leg in briefly and folds her arms across her torso then lifts her knee up to her chest and extends her arms in a slanted t pointing down at serpent
her eyes wide the woman slowly tilts her head side side
her sharpfeatured gaze fixed on snake
the cobra mirrors her weaving left right
as someone stares at the spectacle his head tips side to side well

present day on a bench
the writer watches him with a furrowed brow as adult someone stares into the river them
the writer nods grins
facing the river he forward
a map of the south pacific fills screen
we zoom to the trench
as we push through thick churning storm clouds deck lights illuminate a freighter in the night heavy rains pound on the ocean
ramping off a wave the ships bow lands hard on the seething surface water bursts upwards as it skips to wave
below deck someone slowly awakes in his bunk
his eyes dart about his parents sleep in a bed across room
he leans down to the bottom bunk and shakes his brother
someone quickly pulls himself into his bunk as his mother over
the hands on a travel clock point 117
someone climbs a flight of stairs and enters corridor
the door swings shut him
he staggers and steadies himself on a railing as he along
turning he faces a door with a hole
someone peers through at the lightning flashing in darkness
he turns a latch and the door swings open the wind and rain lash in him
venturing out someone leans over a railing and scans his tempestuous surroundings as he steps along a walkway his feet slide on the flooring
he stumbles as the ship violently rocks and he catches himself on banister
someone climbs stairs to the neck deck and slides on his bare again
he catches himself on a railing and clings to it as he beams down at the churning ocean
stepping back he looks skyward and waves his giddily
he struggles to perform a dance
getting to his feet he notices a red light flashing from a high post falling again someone slides into a barrier at the edge of the deck
he braces himself and climbs to his feet the ship plunges into a wave sending water crashing him
it leaves the upper deck flooded as recovers
someone watches two sailors moving frantically below flashlights
someone reaches for them futilely as they overboard
sobered he races inside
he staggers through corridor
finding his level flooded he dives into the water and swims he passes a zebra
surfaces
gasping then submerges himself and onward
the teen passes through a dark section lit only by the pulsing red lights
reaching a door at the end of the corridor he struggles to it
it springs open releasing a powerful current of water and bubbles
someone hangs onto the door frame and tries futilely to pull himself into his quarters
releasing it he drifts back down the corridor and returns to deck
an animal leaps him
a bird seeks refuge in the nearby tower other animals struggle for footing on the ship
a sailor gives him a jacket
the buddhist struggles to free a lifeboat carrying cook
the buddhist leaps someone
the buddhist captain and the sailor shove him onto the boat someone tumbles across the canvas cover and hangs off the edge the cook signals to the men on ship
someone climbs back up and scrambles around as the others shout him
as someone clings to one set of lines the cook another
the buddhist points as the zebra at the railing of an deck
the boat tips and the cook off
someone loses his grip on the lines and the lifeboat plummets to sea
someone lands on his belly and struggles to hold on as the boat bucks on the churning waters someone slides backward landing at a wave that buoys him back on the again
it carries him past the shouting men at the edge of the ships deck a giant wave washes them view
the lifeboat carries someone through the wreckage a boom sweeps low over head
escaping the wreckage the lifeboat briefly capsizes as it rights itself we find someone holding on tightly and the zebra lying inside someone peers across the giant waves and locates the sinking ship he notices a whistle on his life jacket and it
he frantically waves his arm at ship
peering into the seemingly endless expanse of rolling waves someone spots a figure in water
finding a life preserver he climbs up on the canvas secured tautly over the front half of the boat he casts the flotation device out into the water with all might
the lights of the capsizing ship twinkle and pulse in the distance as someone uses a line to reel in the figure
he slides a long handles oar out from beneath the canvas cover and extends it over the water toward the preserver
two paws and a large furry head emerge from the center of ring
someone jabs futilely at the tiger with the oar a wave carries the beast to the rim
someone grabs on and climbs partially aboard scrambling to the prow someone dives into the water getting his bearings he looks back at the lifeboat then gazes out over the roiling water a giant wave looms stories high him
someone takes a deep breath and submerges the wave briefly rolls him as it by
staying under someone swims past a shark as he makes his way beyond lifeboat
turning he finds himself facing the completely ship
the teen halts and hovers in water
his limbs splayed as he stares at the craft
the deck lights glow as the oceans depths claim vessel
someone looks on helplessly as the ship descends into deep
turning away swims
two other sharks fight over a fresh kill beneath him the tempestuous waters swirl over someone as he makes his way back to surface
the teen thrusts his head above water gasps
with long strokes he swims back to lifeboat
someone grabs for a mast jutting five feet from the prow but a passing wave compromises reach
another carries him to the rim
someone climbs on to the deck with the zebra who lies curled up on its side on end
kneedeep water sloshes around deck
someone climbs back on the canvas cover then scrambles to prow
he leans far out clinging to mast
a wave sends a blast of spray into face
shaking his head he catches his breath and peers down into water
another blast of seaspray drenches teen
he watches helplessly as the ship sinks further beneath the waves
the oceans rippling surface distorts someones view of the vessel
we drift up and away from the boy as the lifeboat carries him over the ships grave
a section at a time the deck lights flicker then out
lightning flashes then diminishes leaving the boy alone in darkness
the next day a seemingly endless expanse of choppy waves roll beneath a low ceiling of storm clouds the lifeboat bobs amidst whitecaps
with the life preserver looped over the prow beam a huddled shivering someone sits in the rain while clinging to the mast with hands
his feet brace against the front of boat
a shark passes him
glancing down at it someone struggles his way to the canvas covered bow and rolls over on top of beam
lifting the edge of the canvas he inside
water sloshes over the floor of boat
the water splashes the zebra who still lies curled up on the wooden benchlike seats rimming the end
one of its hind legs lies unnaturally straight as it drags its haunch along bench
later someone uses a bucket to bail water from boat
with weary dogged motions he scoops out one bucketful another
someone drops the bucket and collapses on the bench near the canvas edge
he leans back his arms draped on the boats rim cover
someone lifts head
a hyena emerges from the shelter
the hyena darts back under the canvas as someone takes up a long handles oar and jumps to the cover
someone the hyena darts out it leaps at someone clumsily and snaps at the oar its jaws clamp on the paddle
someone drops the oar and retreats to the beam
clinging by his arms he swings himself around so his legs dangle over water
curling his abdominal muscles he lifts his legs and fits them through the preserver
from his makeshift seat he watches someone midboat as the hyena tries to climb up onto the canvas the beast makes it only half way up its hind legs staggering with the rocking of boat
the spotted hyena keeps its four paws on the canvas staring someone
it turns its head someone follows its gaze peering across surf
from a cresting wave an orangutan rises into view perched on a bundle
someone ducks into the canvas and the zebra stretches its neck toward the ape
as she draws near we recognize her flotation device has bananas wrapped netting
someone extends an oar to her and she aboard
the teen gives her a weary smile then leans over the side of boat
in the water the banana bundles float free of netting
someone gathers up net
pulls out a stray banana and tosses it to juice
the orangutan lets it bounce off her shoulder and land on the flooded floor of boat
facing someone she grimly works her lips and folds her arms
frowning the teen peers out over sea
as someone faces her with a concerned expression the orangutan lowers her gaze and sighs turning her head over her shoulder she gazes off over water
someone understandingly
someone settles wearily onto canvas
he gives a sigh
now flies swarm around the injured zebra a thin white foam covering lips
standing on the canvas cover turns
he drops to all fours and picks up bucket
lying on his belly he slams it against the hull
the hyena emerges from beneath canvas
rediscovering someone it leaps him
the teen scrambles back and fends off someone with oar
the animal gnaws on paddle
orange juice scoots back on the bench and shrieks as someone bounds passed her and runs in circles the hyena briefly leans over the edge the resumes its wild laps as someone stands ready with oar
someone stops at the center his body convulsing he vomits on floor
licking his chops he makes another try for someone but slumps weakly against canvas
the netting dangles from the base of the beam
someone sits at the bow sharing a vigilant gaze with the hyena who remains back at the edge of canvas
the teen wavers wearily his heavy
glancing over shoulder
someone bounds to the zebra and snaps at its injured leg
the wounded animal kicks at predator
someone and orange juice watch helplessly as someone kills zebra
on a gently rolling current someone sits in the makeshift seat at the boats prow hugging the preserver
dark circles shade his bleary eyes above his red cheeks
someones eyelids droop and he blinks awake
the teen nods again
he falls back into the water hanging by his knees from the preserver
waking he jolts up gasps
the sputtering teen manages to sit up and catch breath
a line of saliva streams from his mouth as he looks around recovers
in the boat the zebra dead
orange juice slumps against the edge of the canvas cover taking slow breaths
he lifts away a hatch beneath the canvas cover and finds a duffle inside opening it he finds a red booklet titled survival at sea lying atop an array supplies
someone takes it out and flips through pages illustrated diagrams
lifting another hatch the teen finds it packed with life jackets he takes one out and tosses it to juice
the orangutan picks it up turning it in her hands and feet as she it
beyond her someone digs out several more jackets
orange juice gives hers a shake the throws down
later using ropes and netting he bundles the life jackets together into a small raft
the life preserver crowns it and three long handled oars crisscross out it
forming six spokes
as someone struggles to maneuver it into water
someone emerges from the shelter
perching atop the zebras carcass he starts to take a bite orange juice angrily thumps the rim of boat
someone turns and stalks the orangutan who backs against the edge
as someone lunges she strikes down
as someone looks on his jubilant fades
orange juice peers down at the hyena then sits on steadily and faces her companion
someone her
he drags her down to the floor and tears her
someone climbs over his raft and unsheathes knife
the hyena retreats to the boats stern cowers
our view sweeps down to orange juices body as it still
blood stains the wood near throat
as he stares down at her someones mournful expression wrathfully
facing someone he swings knife
the tiger springs out from the shelter beneath him landing on the zebra someone kills the hyena with a wrench of his jaws behind him someone scrambles for his makeshift raft as he pushes it overboard the tiger faces him with snarl
standing someone picks up oar
someone swats it from grasp
as the tiger climbs onto the canvas someone curls up in a fetal position with his back to him and squeezes his shut
someone backs off returning his attention to kill
someone leaps from the boat following a rope tethering the raft to lifeboat
he tries to climb on top of the raft but it rolls under weight
later the boy persists as the bundle of life jackets loosens and rolls beneath grasp
he strikes angrily
later still he ties the life jacket to the end of an oar spoke balancing the buoyancy
a shark swims passed as he works it
the boy climbs on top of raft
now someone lies still beneath the shelter
at the boats prow someone peaks in at the tiger he lifts out the duffle of supplies revealing a sizable stock of canned goods and boxed beneath
someone eagerly climbs in to them
now perched at the prow of the lifeboat someone drinks down the contents of can
he fits a plastic lid on top then drops it into a sack nestled at the center of his raft
someone takes a handful of cans from the supply hatch and drops those in well
taking out small boxes he chucks one in and opens other
unwrapping a nutritional biscuit he takes a bite
looking down he finds a sizable rat scurrying over cans
someone watches it as eats
someone lunges him
the tiger halts his claws sticking in canvas
he staggers back snapping irritably at the fabric as a recoiling someone watches with eyes
someone turns his gaze out over the slategrey water them
he walks along the benches lining the boats perimeter pausing to paw at the carcass
with the animal distracted someone starts to climb from prow
someone charges forward his head jetting up from the canvas open flap at bow
his enormous mass knocks someone onto his back on the canvas and the rat scurries along cover
someone emerges from the opening at the boats center and climbs partway up on the canvas the rat climbs up someones arm and over head
the teen grabs rodent
someone pauses hungrily
someone throws the rat at the tiger who catches it in mouth
as someone slurps it down someone jumps off the boat he tries to push away on the raft but finds a line tethering him closely to the prow
as he tries to release the line someone lunges over the prow swiping his massive claws at head
someone ducks and the tiger nearly falls off the boat scraping his rear claws against the painted metal hull the tiger climbs aboard
someone pushes off from the boat on raft
someone returns to the center of the boat as the frightened teen paddles away still securely connected by tether
stopping a few yards from the boat someone vomits into water
at night a full moon shines through a gap in the clouds on boat
someone drags the zebra carcass out view
from his raft someone tearfully
his sits crosslegged his hunched
someone peers out at him from the edge of the boat his parted lips showing his long fangs
the tiger calmly flops his tail as he observes boy
his quivering
someone regards the woefully
thick clouds drift before the enormous moon
as the boat and raft float of gently rolling waves the clouds gradually blot out the moonlight leaving the boy and tiger darkness
now a rising golden sun cuts through dark
as it illuminates the sky we find the boat and raft adrift on perfectly still glassy waters that reflect the sky
as we peer down on them above
we find a perfect mirrorlike image of the sunlit clouds undisturbed on the surface
someone maintains his crosslegged pose as he watches boat
later writes
he uses blank pages in the book
he write with pencil
he presses the tip to the paper making period
later he puts the folded torn out in an empty water can and it
as we watch from distance
someone stands from the center of his raft and throws the can with all might
it lands close to us and bobs peacefully in water
a birdseye view shows the can about ten yards from someones raft sending out gentle ripples over the sea
the boy turns looking over shoulder
tethered a few yards off the lifeboat appears empty peaceful
someone emerges from the canvas shelter at the center of the boat steps up on a seat below rim
he gazes out over the vast expanse of motionless sea
watching him calmly someone crouches down and takes up the tether
tugging hand over hand he reels the closer
at the prow someone lifts the end of the canvas cover and beneath
nestled inside someone snarls up at him but makes no move rise
the carcasses of the zebra and the hyena flank predator
someone gives a small nod and gazes into the animals fierce eyes
the teen lowers the flap then pushes the off
standing along in the vast isolated expanse he turns his gaze toward the sunlit above
now a map from the survival book illustrates the worlds ocean currents with circles
reading it on his bobbing raft someone looks over shoulder
now someone reads through the book and follows advice
someone notices a rash along side
later he lies back his hands over face
he catches rain in the bucket his open mouth and cans in hand
someone collects water puddled on the cover
now ten hash marks mar the hull off the prow someone carves an eleventh with knife
juxtaposed with the scenes someone reads book
on an overcast day he studies the book on raft
pausing he faces boat
someone uses the cone
he drags the boat sideways over waves
he pulls the close
someone emerges from his shelter his ears back and his wide
standing on the raft someone rocks the boat by prow
blinking his amber eyes the tiger hangs his head and nauseously
gritting his teeth someone pushes himself up on the boats cover
he plants his feet wide apart and crouches over getting his balance as he faces tiger
he lunges forward his arms raised and spread someone retreats to the boats stern sits on the rear seat and leans his face over water
someone watches him with wide eyes then reaches for pants
in front of his feet urine hits canvas
finishing someone fiercely downward
someone opens his mouth wide in what appears to be a yawn
he turns putting his tail someone
he sprays the teen in face
sputtering someone rolls off the canvas and the tiger it
now wearing the sea anchor as a hat that shades his face neck shoulders
someone reels in a floating beach ballsized device shaped like a kiss
it dew
harvesting a plastic sack of fresh water someone drinks through straw
he pours the rest into bucket
later he hefts the bucket into the lifeboat setting it on the seat at stern
he raises the whistle to lips
the tiger emerges from shelter
someone pushes off as someone approaches bucket
the tiger bats it gently sniffs it and sticks his in
he writes in the book
he baits a fishing hook with chewed biscuit then lowers it into water
from the lifeboat someone licks his chops as he on
someone him
the boy tries casting the again
later the low sun casts a shimmering beam across the sapphire ocean
someone paces along the seats peering into water
we glimpse a few greentinted shapes swimming just below surface
prepping his fishing line someone glances up at tiger
a few fish splash the surface
someone in
someone looks up his wide
from underwater we watch someone paddling expertly among the fish
his head held high he snaps his jaws at one misses
looking on someone allows an smile
shaking water out of his pressed back ears someone turns him
someones fades
grabbing the tether he tugs hand over fist to reel himself toward boat
someone paddles steadily his calm
as someone nears the boat the tiger draws close him
the teen climbs aboard just as the predator reaches his rafts spokes
the tiger tries to climb the raft then the hull
his claws find no hold in its metal
someone tries climbing aboard the raft from spoke
from the boat someone struggles to heft up raft
lying back he uses one leg as extra leverage the tiger hangs off the far spokes adding to its weight then drops into water
with the raft resting on the cover
someone circles the boat pawing at hull
someone takes a hatchet from the hatch
he glances around then beats someone at the side of the boat and raises hatchet
the tiger hangs on by ropes draped around the hull staring him down someones softens
the mostly submerged tiger stares up at helplessly
clinging to the ropes with his claws
lowering the axe someone gets down and kicks seat
as he looks around someone paddles along the hull and tries again success
someone taps the boats inner wall with his hatchet the ducks into the shelter
he emerges the stands and peers over the side of boat
standing between the two broken stumps of a broken off bench that once stretched across boat
someone looks again
he crouches and lifts up a hatch in front of feet
he sets the sizable pallet of wooden slats on the seat then reaches for raft
at dusk our gaze drifts over the water back to boat
a beam of light dances up through canvas
someone emerges from the shelter with a flashlight hand
shining it over the side he finds someone clinging to the rope
he lowers his raft now larger sturdier and stocked with supplies over the other side of boat
he keeps hold of it with a rope as he crosses back to someones side and puts the whistle to lips
he drops the slatted overboard
attached to the boat with ropes it forms a ladder
as someone uses it to climb board
someone jumps off the other side and lands on raft
standing on his handcrafted vessel
the teen slowly lets out the tether connecting him to boat
someone arrives back board
his soaked fur revealing his frame
as he shakes off
someone watches carefully
the tiger faces him then steps down out view
now under sunlit water we watch fish swim beneath the raft
our view surfaces to find someone seated at one end making notes as he overlooks his stock supplies
he marks off an list
later as he makes modifications to raft
an enormous green fish with a blue crest swims toward a net dangling from the craft
reattaching a life jacket to an oar beam someone pauses and stares down it
the colorful fish swims right into net
reaching down someone gingerly scoops up the other sides closing it off then yanks the fish out of water
straddling the new crisscrossing grid of oar beams someone struggles to wrestle the fish submission
roughly 23 his size the fish thrashes wildly in grasp
someone pins it down on an oar beam stretches one arm out and grabs the hatchet from the edge of the supply pallet he sits up holds the fish down with one hand and uses the other to club the fish with the blunt end of hatchet
he pauses his features set in a glare
the stunned fish feebly works its sharptoothed jaws blood seeps out beneath gill
someone stares with a softened gaze
the fish grows still and its vibrant colors fade to dull mottled shades grey
someone joins his hands bows
later with his whistle between his lips someone hefts the dead fish into the boat
someone creeps out from shelter
standing on the raft grid someone holds onto the boats hull rope as he on
the tiger chomps down on the fish and drags it back into shelter
the teen leans an ear close to hull
someone plants both hands on the painted metal then gently off
on a starry night beneath a full moon countless sea creatures swimming around the boat and raft give off a ceruleanhued glow
from the boats prow the tether sets off the same luminescence where it submerges beneath water
someone takes in the dazzling array of ocean life glowing beneath raft
a few jelly fish gracefully open and shut bells
shifting to all fours on the grid someone dips a hand into ocean
the water gives off a sparkling glow with each motion of hand
he turns and peers off into the distance with eyes
the teen looks around cautiously then returns his attention to water
his lips curl into a delighted childlike smile as he sets off the bright glow with strokes of hand
as his movements gain intensity the resulting glow gathers mass brightness
it illuminates someones grinning face as plays
the boy slows to a halt his fading
from the depths a slowly glowing shape rapidly ascends between the raft lifeboat
its a whale
the creature leaps from the water as big as a ship
someone stares as the gigantic whale corkscrews through the air glowing water streaming from fins
descending it lands on the tether and overturns raft
someone plunges into the water along with the boxes of biscuits and cans water
he quickly makes his way back to the raft and climbs board
from high above we watch the whale create a luminescent trail as it swims an arc around the lifeboat raft
it sprays brightly glowing water from its blowhole then away
now a long row of hash marks wraps around prow
wearing his shirt as turban
someone scratches yet another someone with his knife then sheathes blade
he pushes himself along the hull standing on a new triangular version of raft
now holding the long wooden handle of a bluntedged metal hook
someone tries to pry a grappling tool from the cover
with no luck he cautiously climbs from his raft onto bow
as he tugs at the grappling tool someone emerges from his covered quarters he faces someone with bared
a fish suddenly whacks someone in the face he falls onto the canvas and the fish flops him
someone someone growls as several more shoot over boat
glancing around with wide eyes someone backs away from the tiger and grabs the fish
the teen stands at bow
he hurls the fish at the tigers mouth and it spreads wings the flying fish makes a sharp turn and glides along ocean
the both watch it away
as they turn hundreds of flying fish soar directly them
someone someone frantically swipes at the small fish as someone shields face
the fluttering silver creatures pelt his torso
glancing between his arms someone watches his carnivorous shipmate bat fish from air
the frothy surface seethes around the boat as countless flying fish skip along water
someone flails atop the canvas swinging his arms body
as two fish skitter side by side a larger fish one
the companion fish dodges a breaching predator which we follow as it dips beneath surface
a large spiny fish rapidly cuts through the ocean and leaps out landing in the boat someone someone swipes at it as someones eyes wide
someone wildly swings the boat hook sticking the metal end in someones mouth shaking his head the tiger backs away and swipes at it someone maintains his balance and keeps the boat hook them
someone someone bares fangs
the ferocious animal reluctantly backs away trembling someone grabs his grappling tool and sticks it in the large fish he heaves it onto the canvas and turns starting down someone someone as fish continue by
beneath the angry tiger a pile of fish writhe on the floor
someone someone backs away and focuses on the fish
grabbing the handle of the boat hook someone stands tall atop the canvas his chest heaves as he glares down at tiger
a few fish continue passing by and they skip along the surface
the triangular raft floats beside the lifeboat as someone watches someone feast
at night someone sits on the raft filleting the large fish claimed
the vegetarian warily places a piece of fish in mouth
without hesitation he eagerly slices a large hunk of meat from fish
someone takes in several big bites filling mouth
next day he rubs ointment on a small shin wound and wraps it gauze
sitting on his raft someone uses a knife to carve a wood panel from the boat into a slim spear
now standing on the canvas he challenges someone
the tiger stalks along the port side bench as the teen creeps closer with his spear hand
someone pokes the spear directly in front of someones face and the beast pins back his ears to head
as the brave trainer inches forward someone away
reaching the stern the tiger lies down and kneads its massive paws on the port bench
he gets a claw stuck in the wood and rips it free then shows his teeth someone
the teen flinches but keeps his spear aimed at tiger
someone someone beats his tail against the bench then sits up and raises a paw
he swats at spear
standing his ground someone slowly turns head
watching the tiger out of the corner of his eye he extends the spear him
someone someone swats away
as someone brings the spear back the tiger angrily swipes with both paws charges
facing the beast someone glares and shakes spear
someone someone backs away and lies down at stern
someones gaze softens as he watches the cat
he reaches into a yellow pouch tied around his waist and pulls out a slab fish
glancing between the tiger and the bait he cautiously slides it onto spear
someone someone bares his teeth as someone slowly extends reward
closing his mouth someone someone wiggles his nose and lip at the morsel
someone keeps his eyes locked on the movement
he guides the cats face to the bench and slides the food off spear
someone someone indulges
their eyes connect as the tiger up
and someone remains in the position
he holds out spear
someone taps the port side bench and tosses a piece of fish in the spot
stepping forward someone someone it
as he paws back toward the stern he glares at teen
someones mouth hangs open and he shows a slight grin then glances at the other side of boat
he taps the starboard side and tosses a piece fish
the tiger moves it
someone steps onto the port side bench and taps again relocating the tiger with piece
as he points at the canvas covered section at the bow of boat
someone someone sits down on the starboard bench scowls
someones ears perk up as he shifts his gaze away someone
baring his teeth the tiger backs away from the bow and someone lifts spear
someone charges and the tiger below
someone stares at the draped canvas with eyes
someone someone remains underneath and the victorious teen sits back on the bench at stern
he stays alert with the spear hand
someone gazes with bewildered eyes his dry cracked lips rest open
later he stands on raft
building a canvas canopy attached to a cross
rope tied from a crossbar to the raft holds the flat
someone someone watches from boat
someone lounges underneath in a makeshift hammock
he takes out his survival journal and pencil
now he stabs sharks
on the raft someone uses two pails as a dholak drum then stops
someone quickly stands and moves around the raft gazing at a massive school dolphins
they dip in and out of the ocean about 100 away
a flock of seagulls fly along them
someones smiling mouth hangs open as he follows movement
far behind them a large ship appears on horizon
someone waves his arms and stares ahead then quickly moves to the other side of raft
he pulls a flare gun from his survival pack and checks chamber
facing the ship he cocks the gun and raises it in air
someone someone watches the flare burst in the sky and retreats below canvas
someone reloads and again
he glances toward the ship then swiftly grabs flare
later the ship resembles a speck on the horizon moving toward the massive sun
orange signal smoke wafts from the raft as someone waves a different type flare
now only a small pink glow marks horizon
on his raft someone gazes out with eyes
he glances back at someone someone who sits calmly on boat
someone raises the flare gun beside his sullen face and upward
from a distance the bright orange flare briefly illuminates the dark night sky and the screen fades black
from directly overhead we view sharks and large fish swimming just beneath boat
a massive whale shark passes
at night reflections of stars glimmer on the water
the tiger remains still keeping his fixed
someone watches the cat
someones ear twitches and he slowly turns his head looking down into the ocean
glancing from the regal beasts profile toward water
someone climbs to knees
the weakened teen gazes over the side of boat
behind him hundreds of stars sparkle across the calm sky
beyond his reflection in the water someone someone watches a slim fish swim by with a soft blue glow trailing it
several more follow as we move through the tigers image and below surface
now dozens of fish cut through the water and a shark swims into school
a large squid emerges from the abyss
pumping its tentacles the squid propels itself farther from view
as a large whale approaches the squid latches onto back
the whale frantically swims about with the flailing squid squeezing its tentacles
suddenly the whale transforms into a jumble of animals
as they burst apart the squid becomes a school of fish
a hippo rhino giraffe and other disperse
mixed in with a sea turtle manta ray and other life
a brilliant light zooms and reveals a snaggletooth angler fish with an antenna
diving deeper into abyss
tiny particles erupt into vibrant pockets of light
we move through a glowing orange trail and dissipating blue particles into an array of teal and bubbles
a glowing blue lotus flower quickly dissolves and forms into someones mother
a pink creature swims before her smiling face as we zoom through her forehead into blackness
now the tsimtsum lies on the ocean floor a blue and teal glow surrounds the ship
our view suddenly backtracks out of the water through someones reflection
perched on the bench someone someone watches his shipmate
someone remains in a kneeling position gazing over side
the boat resembles a white speck on a vast surface
as someone writes the lead runs out on his pencil
he lies over the journal and rolls the half inch stub between fingers
later a thick cloud brews in distance
lightning flashes in the section
someone glares at it then faces someone
the tiger finishes grooming his paw and up
now the raft floats on choppy water beside bow
someone unties his canvas canopy and takes down the post
kneeling on the raft he quickly collects his tools as the agitated surface intensifies him
with his ears pinned back someone someone takes cover under canvas
someone secures his tools in the bow and grabs journal
as a large wave sprays over strong wind whips away
he falls forward and rolls off the canvas into the water
someone watches the journal get sucked into the sky
he climbs onto the boat and secures a rope around torso
rain pounds down as the boat rocks between surging waves someone brushes his chin length hair from his face and sees a yellow beam of light protruding through a hole in the cloud
a massive lightning bolt smacks down beside the boat spreading a web of brilliant electricity beneath surface
a large wave knocks someone off the canvas and into the boat he struggles to feet
he pounds on canvas
he stares into the sky with a huge smile then pulls himself to a crouching position on the bench ocean water pours over the frenzied teen as he rips the canvas free of each hook trying to uncover friend
a massive wave suddenly overtakes the lifeboat it briefly suspends underwater then shoots through surface
someone continues unhooking the canvas as the boat ramps off surging waves he uncovers someone
the tiger flails around in the boat desperately clawing at the side to keep his head above water perched on the bow someone gazes at the panicked animal as swirling water covers them both lightning fills sky
a wall of water crashes down knocking someone off boat
his raft floats atop the water
with the rope around his waist he climbs back up the side and flops onto bench
shaking his head someone blinks rapidly and sees someone someone struggling across boat
the tiger manages to secure his front legs on bench
someone glances behind him and pulls himself up then crawls to his feet at bow
the teen grips the edge and steadies himself up ahead the violent ocean surface pulls the raft farther from boat
someone gazes longingly after it then glances back at someone someone and grabs the cover
he struggles to secure it to the hooks along bow
in the distance a brilliant lightning bolt strikes down followed by flashes of lightning throughout thin pockets in clouds
now someone secures the canvas to the final hook and beneath
water rushes along the boat and completely him
as it recedes he lies on the bench gasping air
the boat rocks the water to the stern and washed someone someone off the bench someone
someone someone lies next to someone as the water recedes from both
he desperately claws at the bench but the water in the rocking boat sweeps him back to stern
someone watches the tiger climb onto the bench just as the water rushes back and submerges teen
now sun shines on someones back through a hole in canvas
water calmly sweeps up over the bench him
he looks across the boat at someone someone who sleeps on the bench in a small shaft sunlight
two feet of ocean water rocks from side to side in boat
pushing more canvas back someone squints as bright sun blankets face
the rolling ocean settles from storm
sunlight shines on someone who stands atop the canvas covering lifeboat
a short length of rainbow prism light filters from the dark clouds on horizon
viewed from high overhead the half covered lifeboat resembles a tiny twotoned capsule adrift in a sea black
the darkness rapidly lightens to a shimmering and opaque surface with reflected clouds
by the side of the boat a few raindrops land in the water causing tiny ripples
someone drinks from a plastic pail
he lowers it to reveal dead sunken eyes and untamed black hair forming a nest around his drawn and face
his blurry gaze shifts into focus revealing someone someone emaciated and lying on the bench with one dangling
someone gently steps toward him across the cover
holding the yellow container by side
using the rim of the boat for support he steps onto the bench and approaches the beast
standing back he reaches out and tilts the container over head
a thin stream of water lands in the mouth
the cats lip reflectively curls barely exposing his razor teeth
the tiger swallows with a breath
with saddened eyes someone lowers himself toward the creature
the gaunt voyagers hand trembles as he reaches toward the beasts head
as he touches the fur of someones brow the cat briefly flinches then still
the teens eyes glisten and his tremble
the tiger weakly looks up at him as someone strokes forehead
he holds his hand still for a moment then away
holding onto the rim of the boat someone takes a seat beside the animal
he places the yellow contain aside and slides closer to tiger
someone lifts his companions head resistance
and nestles close to animal
he rests the tigers head on his lap and softly rubs crown
he stares for moment
then looks up at the sky as despair wells in eyes
a teardrop travels down his face neck
drops of rain land on someones sunblistered face chest
he leans close to tiger
someone someone nuzzles his head on lap
the teen rubs the head
the boat drifts on the calm water
fade black
now lying on the sundappled canvas someones eyes open
a gentle breeze wafts through his bushy hair
he gazes up with barely eyes
he glances to side
the lifeboat rests on a green and shore
only feet from the waters edge densely packed trees form a forest
someone rolls over and props himself up on his arms
he crawls to the bow of the craft and peers down through a hole in canvas
someone climbs off boat
as he steps on to terraferma his legs give out and falls
he picks himself up onto his knees and pulls from the boat the grappling tool attached to rope
he anchors the tool firmly around a moss root
he removes a leafy bit inspects it then puts it in mouth
after a few curious bites he down
tears up more of the leafy bits and shovels them into mouth
a wider view reveals tall bushy trees towering over the lifeboat and all along the edge of what appears to be island
someone tears off a chunk of root and inspects the light pink center within its dark green shell
he takes a large bite chews
he closes his eyes eats
now someone walks through the forest of lanky green growth similar to trees
branches intertwine over ahead creating shade as passes
a layer of densely interlocked roots covers ground
someone climbs up a small hill using an arched root support
he turns his head and approaches crest
he looks out over a vast area where the ground seems to ungulate around several pools
thousands of meerkats stand up straight with their tawny fur covered chests out
their whiskered snouts quiver as their darkly inset eyes peer in directly
now someone walks among the kneehigh mammals waving his hand them
they scatter among bones on ground
someone approaches a glistening pond surround by a three foot tall bank roots
meerkats run around him as he sits at the edge reaching one down
he tests the water with his toes then in
he raises his head from the pond and around
swimming forward he opens his mouth wide and fills it water
someone tilts his head back and takes a gulp
he smiles as he looks at the surrounding mass water
viewed from overhead meerkats surround the deep blue almostperfectly round pool with green roots fringing perimeter
someone swims to the center the rolls over and backstrokes beneath sun
he swims to the edge of pond
now he rests against the root wall and splashes water on face
later he climbs out of the pond and notices the meerkats staring him
he turns to see someone someone walking through the field of attentive creatures
the tiger grabs a meerkat in his teeth and swings its body
someone presses his lips together with a resigned smile as someone someone lies down and eats meal
someone treks through the forest on own
looking down he stops and unties someones string bracelet unwrapping it from wrist
he crouches down and ties it around a root
later a beam of light dissipates over the ocean as the sun lowers into horizon
soft red light ripples over water
someone ties a net between branches the width of torso
he looks out over the field as thousands of meerkats stampede into forest
the creatures climb into the trees someone turns his head and sees someone someone springing toward lifeboat
the meerkats scatter up the branches around someone a few crawl into net
he pushes away
more surround him as he attempts to lie in the hammock
he smiles as a few of them jump on top him
at night a meerkat yawns with his hind legs hanging over branch
its head slumps over and it falls toward another meerkat
a group of them lie across branch
a smaller one nuzzles noses with a meerkat
then cuddles up with a one
someone rolls over in hammock
a rippling blue and green light glows onto the bottom of branch
a meerkat climbs onto someones back and rests across shoulder
someones eyes open up and he peeks over branch
he stands up and holds a branch support
with his mouth ajar he stares down at a pool emitting a phosphorescent light
the body of a large dead fish surfaces and floats atop the water beside dozens of smaller fish
the soft light glows on someones face as he looks down mouthed
more fish die and float to the surface of the pool
someones fearful gaze up
he trembles as a breeze brushes over the trees
a glowing light shimmers around lifeboat
someone someone sits up and stares inland as the boat lightly bobs on water
beneath him the same eerie light surrounds lifeboat
from a distance the island shows contours like that of the human body lying on back
a teal light glows beneath surrounding the island
now someone rips a spherical object from a branch
his eyes fixate on it as he spins it between hands
overlapping leaves surround orb
as he peels back the layers the inner part of the leaves glow along veins
the leaves separate to reveal a black and tooth
his eyes fix on the tooth
light reflects off his face
now at house
at sunset someone kneels on the lifeboats canvas cover and ties up bundles roots
someone hops off the boat inland
he blows the whistle and stares up hill
with his mouth open someone watches as someone someone hurries down the hill him
he unanchors the hook from the root and waits for the tiger to hop board
the boat floats into distance
later someone tumbles off the side and grabs onto a rope connected to bow
underwater his feet graze the sand as he pulls the boat shore
someone struggles with boat
beyond the shore line a jungle looms in distance
someone collapses onto the sand as the boat sways with waves
later someone lies prone on the beach his arms out stretched from sides
someone looks up as someone someone hops over him from lifeboat
the tide washes over the claws
the scrawny tiger stretches yawns
the tiger awkwardly ambles across sand
sand covers someones face as he peers at beast
now at adult house
he takes a long breath blinks
on the beach someone struggles to keep his head up collapses
later a group of men jog him
he stares into jungle
agape
he stares and cries as they carry away
at his house adult someones glisten
with his mouth open the story teller stares at guest
the writer lowers gaze
he wipes nose
a tear spills from eye
his lips twitch and he down
the writer blinks at him then briefly away
he watches someone wipe the tears from cheeks
the writer lightly tilts his head and shifts eyes
someone looks off turns
he stands and approaches cabinet
the writer takes report
now at hospital
they stare someone
the younger japanese man stares at someone as the older one turns him
the older man flips the tape in recorder
they sit at the foot of someones bed
the older man nods and raises eyebrows
someone swallows and off
the older someone leans back with his arms folded and off
the teen frowns
someone gives a nod
someone allows a fawned smile
it fades and he takes on a expression
someone lowers his eyes and shakes head
he bites his lip
the younger insurance rep solemnly faces partner
the older man shifts his grim gaze
someone faces the older man earnestly then away
as the young survivor hangs his head the older insurance investigator faces his partner with a gaze
he looks back at the teen and his brow uneasily
the orphans eyes fill tears
someones mouth twists willfully and his flare
he stares mournfully
his expression hardens and someone turns his earnest gaze on the man
tears stream down cheek
facing the young investigator someone sniffles and shakes head
someones parted lips show a chipped tooth
he stares off with a haunted expression and takes a breath
at someones house the young writer stares off with parted lips and a brow
the middle aged someone faces his guest with a gaze
the writer gives a frown
the writer gazes at the mild mannered man
the young nods
someone regards the younger man with a calm expression
the writer shifts his thoughtfully
his deep set eyes glistening someone gives a smile
someones grows
the writers eyes sparkle and the corners of his lips up
he lowers his eyes tries to bite back his smile fails
the two men share a smile

he makes his way through a crowd of red soldiers who part to let by
the two opponents guarding the flag
he takes a flag on its pole
beside him someone gives a nod and raises his staff congratulations

where a pristine replica of the long multi columned stands
now children play around a man making giant soap bubbles on the lawn
centennial park the parthenon entrance parking
as they approach the entrance

he removes the pearl from setting
mist rises around the custodians as they drift together

now a tv in a diner shows a news report as the young eat
now the pickup travels past an airport tarmac situated across the street from a sign reading welcome to fabulous las nevada
as the truck drives through strip
a fountain jets water in front of a cluster of hotelcasinos
they pass a row of older casinos blaring lights
fireworks blossom over a pair of high rises lit in a pattern
an illuminated logo shows a dark pink domeshaped flower over the words lotus hotel casino

the teens eye the sports car then head to the casinos crowded area
elaborate roller coasters and a someone wheel loom behind fountain
as they move on a waitress intercepts them with a tray of pink doeuvre
wide shifting

and another feeds him a flower
a waitress presents a tray of lotus flowers them
now someone reclines in a plush white bathrobe with cucumber slices over his eyes a buxom manicurist files his nails while a pedicurist paints his cloven hooves red
as someone and someone on
he drops into a split then springs up using only his legs
perfectly synchronized series movements
as he moves through the casino a waitress him
he reaches a crowded video game arcade and pauses about
he stops at a pinball machine played by a thin young man with long corn hair
he turns away and heads through a 1950s themed area
he passes a craps table then comes to a game
a softly glowing green pearl sits nestled in one of the slots as someone stares at it a waitress swoops in him

the sports car plows through a pair of glass doors and speeds out of the brightly lit dropoff area cutting through a busy intersection the maserati swerves into the flow of traffic then races past the cars
a blaze of lights sears words next to the coast
someone clenches the steering wheel the maserati weaves around the other cars as it speeds down strip
drive carefully come soon
the sports car races through a barren desert landscape under a sky darkened with clouds
thunderheads swirl over the iconic sign
the radio plays a report
later the teens scramble along the base of its letters
graffitied greek letters rearrange themselves to form a message english
then stares past sign
where the earth grumbles away to make a door fissure
space
glow from circular recesses in walls
as the teens follow a path along a broad river
fill the doorway him
they find a gaunt man in a monk like robe standing in rowboat
his features
someone leads his over
it bursts flames
the ferryman looks at him then extends hand
and the man closes his bony fingers them
as the teens take their seats the ferryman pushes away from dock
the boat exits through a freestanding letter h in a towering hillside sign that hell
someone points at a trail of objects
then releases it into the stream of objects
on the jagged edge of cliff
he shifts his gaze to an ominous mansion which looms on a column of rock in the middle of gorge
oldfashioned lamp posts bookend either side of a area
climb out of boat
a threetiered fountain sits in foyer
gulps
now the teens follow someone into an enormous room
carved reliefs of bound emaciated men flank a fireplace
he wears a leather vest and pants and a black shirt with stylishly tattered sleeves facing someone he spreads arms
he morphs into the giant demon
then gives hades an smile
he picks up a globe made of bones and smashes it on the ground the shattered pieces dissolve smoke
cloud takes on human form and materializes someone
flickers from behind the shields strap
then holds him out at arms length and gazes tearfully him
their attention hades
someone and someone also watch as the god of the underworld stoops down and shifts the arm strap aside on shield
which grows longer as he pulls out
they stalk closer backing someone and the others toward souls
pushing the group to within a few feet of fire
skips
they stop their advance and the fireplace grate closes behind group
with the bolt clutched in her hand someone kneels hades
taking the bolt from someone he retrieves the glowing pearls from pocket
he someone and someone place their pearls on the floor then crush them under feet
billows out engulfing their legs and travels up bodies
which snakes its way out of room
someone and someone watch as the smoky disappears
she wiggles an finger
a smoking trail zooms through the night sky making its way past the pointed art deco crown of the building
it swoops through the protective fence that surrounds the empire state buildings deck
then morphs into someone someone someone
someone points to dark storm clouds gathering above the pinnacle
hovering in the air someone swings his legs around and kicks someone in head
the lightning thief pulls out his sword sparks fly as someone deflects his blow with a bolt
someone kicks him knocking him to the ground the bolt falls from hand
but someone swoops past her and it
the three companions fall to the floor as lightning zaps the safety barrier them
with a power hungry smile someone blasts away a chunk of deck
someone scrambles to his backpack and pulls out his own pair of sneakers
he spots a helicopter rising in his direction and takes aim with bolt
a flying someone knocks him from the ledge and they plummet past the deck
circle each other and come together again in a grasp
someone swings at someones face then pins him against the building the someones back grinds against the wall as he continues to downward
someone lands on a roof
he steers himself toward an skyscraper
someone shoots it with lightning as someone swoops through an floor
someone bursts through a wall and him
it tumbles out of building
he soars back toward the empire state building his shoes wings furiously
someone throws a dagger it slices off one of someones wings the hero plummets losing his grip on the bolt as it tumbles toward a rooftop with a skylight
as it tumbles toward a rooftop with a skylight
then weakly pushes himself up on fours
in bolt
eyeing a water tower behind someone someone shuts his eyes the someone smugly
he aim
turning someone sees water jet from its splitting seams the tanks cap flies off and its contents gush out in a arc
another vat nearby bursts open and the two streams converge someone unleashes water from two more tanks and it all combines to form a giant flowing barrier around rooftop
the son of poseidon holds the water at bay on either side himself
someone flings his hands forward the someone fires but the water rushes in at him it douses the charge and engulfs him energy crackles within the swirling mass the maelstrom tosses someone about like a toy and the bolt wrenches from grasp
which evaporate in the air
someone bends over resting his hands on knees
water rises to form a trident in the heros hand catching the someone around the throat it sends him flying out into river
catching the someone around the throat it sends him flying out into river
someones winged sneakers flap uselessly it
someone carries the bolt in one hand and his sword in the other as he lands on the deck
in a supply closet someone flips some switches on an electrical panel across the room two shelving units part to reveal double doors which slide open displaying the interior of elevator
the greek letter omega gleams in the center of a emblem
the lights flicker as they brace themselves inside the chamber
then burst from pinnacle
our view drifts past storm clouds to four towering pillars stationed around a stone booth on platform
and someone steps out someone
the base of a magnificent palace illuminating its facade
timepiece sits in the center of a hall
while someone watches from throne
the gods obediently take their seats in a semicircle of white chairs someone rises from his throne at the center and eyes timepiece
a clockwork second hand rotates above panes of glass with markings
casts onto the diminutive figures of the teens the gods tower over them at more than feet
someone poseidon and the goddess with the long brown curls stare down at teens
the demigods rush forward to meet him he leans down and holds out his hand
in someones hand the bolt grows in size intensity
someone glances at a brown haired god who confusedly
poseidon
then shifts his proud gaze to son
someone glances at someone who firmly holds stare
to seat
the beautiful goddess eyes the bolttoting god as sits
someone touches the shoulder
poseidon morphs into water and catches up with his son in form
poseidon extends his arm and they shake hands while sharing an stare
then he off
they stop walking as they notice someone sword fighting four male students at the time
as someone continues across the lawn more students pat back
blood caked on shoulder
then raises hand
but someone snatches sword
she keep sword at throat
they each twirl their weapons in preparation and position themselves for fight
someone blocks two of his strikes and swipes back him
our view widens to take in all of the battling demigods on the field
we keep pulling back until our view encompasses the entire clearing the surrounding forest and the lakeshore which meanders off into distance
an enormous saucer shaped craft hovers just above the rim of falls
the plunging water sends up pale mist that swirls around ship
from a distance we watch a cloaked hooded figure walk over a rocky bank to the rim
from within the hood a stonewhite human like face with masculine features peers out through deepset eyes with enormous irises
he serenely looks up at the ascending craft
the humanoid sets out a bowl with a heavily lid
he doffs cloak
revealing a pale hairless body of flawless muscle tone and proportion wearing only a primitive undergarment around hips
the humanoid crouches and uncaps bowl
a membrane covering a small disintegrates
standing the humanoid peers into the cup and its disintegrating honeycomblike contents the humanoid brings the cup to his lips drinks
he watches the craft
still holding cup
he over
it drops from his grasp and plummets over falls
large dark lesions break out all over body
one makes a seam down the side of his face and he stares at his arm
our view swoops close and follows one of the lesions as it creates a trench along limb
a black fluid gushes it
within a microscopic view shows golden strands of dna blackening then apart
on cliff
the flesh between the humanoids shoulder blades tears open
as he leans his head back it emits countless black particles like ash that float through air
he leans forward on arm
it snaps in two and he tumbles over falls
the swarm of black particles swirls in the air above the bank as the plunging figure vanishes into mists
under water the mangled body dismembers as it sinks his neck rips apart beheading him as he down
another swarm of black particles escapes his shell and swirls through water
following them we watch the golden dna strands rebuild blacken
clean white lines appear gradually forming letters that spell title
now zygotes multiply cells
fade black
in the darkness light streams in as a hand works bits of rock free from the other side of wall
a flashlight shines in at us through hole
a woman pulls more rock away increasing size
as she peers in we glimpse her brown eyes and features
auburn bangs peak out from under hat
clearing away more rubble she peers through the hole again and excitedly
now a figure moves down a steep verdant slope in mountains
two more figures leave a cave high behind him as he waves arms
from a campsite another man steps closer and lowers a scarf from face
holloway glances back at two colleagues then drops a pan and dashes up slope
appear
2089 isle of scotland
later in cave
holloway pulls a plastic curtain aside and his female colleague steps through with flashlight
she nimbly along
then lights holloways path as he comes in her
he picks his way carefully over the rocky floor and joins the woman at side
she hands over flashlight
its beam illuminates primitive paintings
holloway sweeps the light over walls
his colleague moves to the edge of the cavernous space then watches him with a smile
he wanders closer to her his flashlight beam revealing renderings of galloping horses and illustrations of people together
holloway faces colleague
she directs the upward
high on wall
a large human points up at discs
holloway pulls off his fur hat
holloways colleague smiles with tears in eyes
her hand reaches out and interlaces his
he shines the flashlight on her pretty face
she faces amazedly
then returns her gaze to painting
the flashlight beam sweeps up the arm
the beam lingers on the six floating discs fade black
as stars twinkle from within a cloudy nebula a point of light passed
a beam shines brightly from a chunky spacecraft as turns
onboard automated doors open to reveal a trim blond man in a jumpsuit
now a monitor showing vital signs bears the name someone the man presses it with finger
wearing a helmet with a glowing amber visor over eyes
he touches a long casket like pod its clouded glass clears revealing colleague
clad in bandagelike undergarments she appears sleep
using a touch screen built into the glass the man accesses an amberhued memory of a little girl watching men carry a body on litter
her father prepares meal
a womans image appears vanishes
he wears cross
an image shows his hand laying the cross hers
the young someone regards the priest
the trim man appears at the center
as the transmission ends the man lingers with his hand on the touch screen then away
now he touches a panel and doors open him
holding a basketball in one hand he strides through the chambers
lights turn on as he passes then blink again
pausing by a table he crouches and picks something up off the floor
moving on he bounces ball
in a cockpit he activates a computer with a threedimensional screen
a screen at the top shows a girl playing violin
now on a basketball court with a row of treadmills at one end someone rides a bicycle circles
he shoots the basketball from the bike and it goes through basket
now someone eats a bowl of white mush with spoon
his attention fixed on a holographic video him
at another time he bounces his basketball as he walks the corridors
a plays
as te lawrence peter otoole extinguishes a match with his fingertips silhouetted against the screen watches
hair dye plasters his roots at a mirror someone styles his hair
someone combs his golden hair to match peter otooles style later he moves through a corridor
someone halts unsteadily
quickly regaining his balance he observes racked silver billiard balls and a cue rolling across a blue table
frowning someone moves to a panel types
lights blink on and off throughout the corridors as he returns to cockpit
he flips switches activating lights and computers across bridge
holographic screens blink on above the front stations each offering data
someone strides to one and pushes button
from the nose outer panels part giving view through the glass windows to a pale gray planet floating amidst a sea stars
someone forward
his eager gaze fixed on the orb
his deepset blue eyes wistfully
near an enormous ringed planet the stocky insect shaped turns
someone opens a pair doors
looking down he cocks his head frowns
a sleeper pod lies open empty
he follows wet prints of bare feet down a corridors black floor
on illuminated floor panels a soaking wet woman clad in bandagelike undergarments does pushups with a stare
someone arrives outside door
someone fully parts that partially open doors and steps into chamber
the lean womans long blond hair drips around her face as she completes routine
someone presents her with robe
she puts on
she takes clothes from rack
now back in the groups sleep chamber someone moves among the pods
fluid streams from someones bare feet as they dangle from pod
she vomits into bowl
he lays a blanket over back
sitting near by holloway drinks fluids someone again
now in a hall
in flight suits and hoodies someone holloway and ragtag crew members get food beverages
in a sleek highcollared suit the arrives
she spies a brawny charming man setting up a small christmas tree on the table
he takes a small cigar from mouth
a mohawked man broth
a bespectacled sits
he extends a hand the mohawked glares
someone gives an intimidated nod smiles
the rest of the crew joins the pair in a briefing area set on the court
sitting at the front someone uses a tablet to activate a huge 3d video
a little dog accompanies an man
a living area appears before him as advances
someones fades
they comply
someone and holloway go to either side of the speaker
as weyland turns and walks away his surroundings out
the holographic man vanishes ending playback
he shows a cube
holloway presses a few squares that make up the cube and it projects a series images
he lines up the images to show patterns
he sets the discs in map
he zooms the in
he shows the planet
the gray sphere it
the mohawked crewman gives nod
grins
holloway nods someone
the mohawked crewman lays his face in hands
someone laughs then up
someone regards someone attentively then lowers his gaze
now blue flame glows within the prometheus jets as it nears the moon
it around
bringing its angle parallel with the curve
the sun casts a thin crest of illumination across the pale blue and surface
in a corridor someone walks ahead holloway
someone smiles them
he escorts them into a luxurious environment
windows give the illusion of a peaceful scene
someone away
someone rejoins group
at a bar someone uses a shaker
the windows show field
someone serves drinks
someone stares and holloway bitterly
now multiple screens show data and imagery over computer
turning his computer off someone smiles and away
the crew straps in
someone puts up his hood and hugs his jacket closed the ship descends clouds
the small stout someone descends through a storm
lightning flashes around ship
they pass jagged mountains peeking from thick mist as the sun shines through clouds
fog parts revealing a barren valley dotted with hills
another field shows swirling patterns indicating previous flow
a dome shaped formation juts from a range hills
we gaze down on the someone as it progresses past jagged blades rock
someone faces the woman
he gives smile
now we soar through a barren unforgiving range
the ship slows as it approaches a gap between outcroppings
holloway eyes a display monitor it shows a structure peeking out from behind mountain
he up
he peers out window
clearing the gateway the ship turns towards a low structure built in the valley
the ships jets downward
they slow the ships descent to a pace
the jets bring up massive clouds of dust around the ship as it down
overhead the enormous ringed planet glows softly beside sun
domes resembling the tops of beehives surrounded by stone walls dot the valley in file
roughly a mile apart from other
on board someone holloway rushes to the front windows while someone warily
other members of the crew move forward out
holloway kisses head
now the survey team up
beneath their clear helmets skullcaps bear their names the scottish woman bears the someone
someone notices a crewmen wielding flamethrower
in a suit holloway presses buttons on sleeve
a large boxy chamber descends from the underside
in the airlock a hatch rises the crew steps into hanger
someone brings a duffel to the front of a transport vehicle with twin rows seats
as the mohawked man sits someone takes the seat him
the mohawked man moves down a spots
the hanger hatch lowers making an ramp
the transport pulls out alongside atvs
in the transport holloway moves close someone
chuckles
he presses her helmet to his with an ardent gaze then away
someone adverts her gaze
the transport leads the two atvs to an opening in a wall surrounding structure
a sharp crust tops the beehive doom
holloway and someone come forward crowding the front of the cabin with someone as they stare out windshield
the crust rounded front gives a hint of winderoded carving of face
the survey vehicles pull up around the dome park
a side hatch in the transport rises and someone leads the out
her helmets computerized view shows long low entrances carved into the base
in the dark cockpit someone stands behind the chair
the other survey team members leave the atvs up
holloway ventures forward and follows
the team members approach one of the entry ways each carrying a kit or bag of size
we peer up at the approaching humans from a sandy slope dotted with rocks
crossing the threshold they head down slope
someone regards the space with a expression
a view through a helmet camera shows a few of the team exploring the space
various readings border the image along with the users someone
now holloways view closes in on a opening
as the team ventures in holographic monitors each show the captain a crew members computerized view
venturing through opening
someone draws himself up with an stare
follows
on the other side someone and the mohawked man linger sharing an gaze
someone ducks first
the other man glances fearfully over shoulder
further in the team passes through a archway
and enters a tunnel perpendicular to path
they pause shining their lights in direction
the mohawked man orbs
someone releases two into the air spinning they shine red scanner beams in all directions as they fly down corridor
he sends two more off the way
the last scanning pup vanishes around turn
leaving his chair the captain goes to a table
as he activates its computerized system someone someone and someone him
in the 3d holograph flying red beacons map out a system
yellow beacons marked with surname initials someone the team members locations the pups split off again as the extending network of tunnels grows complex
the survey team reaches a rounded tunnel of dark stone
as he leads them on someone curiously shines her flashlight at the etched walls
someone takes up the rear closely observing surroundings
they venture towards a faint light in distance
now beams of light sweep erratically rock
rounding a turn the survey team steps into view slows
the stand in a chamber where water streams to around pit at center
a pup doubles back from the far wall and drops down pit
water rains around the probe as it plunges stories
holloway taps keys on sleeve
holloway unlatches his helmet then bends over and pulls it off straightening he inhales deeply and pulls off skullcap
his breath clouds air
smiles
glaring scoldingly at holloway someone removes helmet
in cockpit
the away team moves through a space
hiking a tunnel they sweep flashlights over surroundings
trailing behind someone spots a panel with carved dots and lines high up on wall
climbing up he notices greenish slime dripping from a few of the points
someone collects some on his fingertip
then presses it to thumb
as they part the slime stretches between fingertips
glowing blue particles within
someone it
unnoticing the others venture ahead him
someone runs his finger along a few of the lines and presses the dots
they light up beneath touch
a screen of glowing blue particles forms and races down tunnel
pausing the human team turn
he stares at an light
glowing blue particles form several giant humanoids racing down tunnel
as someone remains in their path they wash over him wind
holloway sweeps someone out of their way the incorporeal figures continue down tunnel
the team runs after the giant figures
lagging behind the others a lone apparition stumbles and falls it gets up and runs on as those ahead dart out view
holloway and someone arrive in time to watch it collapse at a doorway its ghostly hatch lowers on top of him and vanishes
staying someone with a hand holloway ventures forward the others arrive him
a body lies at door
the team it
at the door holloway and someone spy ancient text carved into stone
the strange characters fill rows
someone starts leave
he marches indignantly
leaning close to someone someone wheels around and leaves someone
now as holloway someone and someone examine the body
someone climbs ladder
holloway hands over a flashlight device
as someone studies the carved symbols in the wall someone inserts a probe from the carbon reader into the being
someone taps the symbols which light up briefly with touch
as a pup moves in to scan the revealed chamber someone kneels just on the other side of door
her flashlight beam reveals a head three times the size of a humans with a short elephant trunk
holloway moves further inside transfixed by an enormous bust
someone steps further in studying the face
the sculpture towers over hundreds of sleek gray thigh urns
someone and someone follow the others into room
one of their boots lifts from the soft dirt revealing worms about
someone and someone aim their flashlights at the ceiling
holloway moves deeper in through the evenly urns
someone crouches down for a better look at one and reaches out it
condensation beads on its flat topped surface
as someone gazes slackjawed at the statue
holloway continues on around to a recess it
a relief of snakelike creatures surrounding a central humanoid figure adorns wall
as holloway steps around a pedestal
his flashlight beam shines through a huge emeraldlike stone jutting from center
someone kneels at urn
a tarlike substance oozes top
the android tilts his head curiously and touches some spilling down the side with a finger
someone moves her flashlight beam across the ceiling
the changes
the woman rushed back to the head
on the surface storm clouds swirl menacingly in sky
on board someone someone studies images of the storm on monitor
in the chamber someone and someone lift the head into a bag
someone turns to watch someone leave bridge
kneeling at a clean urn someone sprays it with a gaseous substance from a canister
someone and someone hoist the head up them
holloway leaves the carved relief in the wall someone surreptitiously packs the urn in a bag
as he walks away the black ooze pools around urn
the worms wriggle it
outside the dome the four researchers find only atvs
someone and someone get one
holloway drives off with someone on the atv
a dark shadow passes over them above thick black clouds engulf the dome and the enormous carved skull on crest
on the road leading towards someone the atvs travel in the dusty wake of transport
as the storm engulfs us jagged shards whip around then block out our view of the vehicles
from a long distance the storm appears as a swiftly moving wall of roiling dirt on someone someone watches the approaching vehicles storm
the transport makes it into the hanger as the atvs speed in one hits a bump and the bagged head off
someone races it
as someone grabs it the silica storm knocks her 50 yards into one of the ships towering landing struts holloway takes atv
on the screen someone watches holloway leave ship
the hatch closes holloway someone
as holloway climbs out of the vehicle it away
the atv tumbles through storm
as they take each others hands amid the whirling shards an outer door opens on ship
someone clips himself to a cable attached to someone meanwhile the storm someone
holloway struggles to keep a hold on her as someone steps out the storm bounces him around he makes it over to holloway and helps him pull someone back into a recess made by the forked strut
the android calmly clips the humans to his line and gives someone the okay signal
he lifts a remote control and the line pulls them back towards the open door in ship
the clustered trio bobs and bounces as the line carries them through the harsh wind and flying shards a crew member helps pull them board
later as they move through the hanger a crew member blasts the floor with a thrower
someone and someone walk through a tunnel
the two trapped men move on through the dark cramped space meanwhile in a lab on board someone the head someone collected rises into a glass chamber a white mist blasts it filling the chamber and an image appears on monitor
as the head slides from the chamber arrives
someone activates an arched scanner that glides over head
as someone studies one monitor someone steps over the image of the head another
as holloway plops down nearby with a bottle liquor
someone easily releases the helmet lifting the trunk snout
carefully lifting the large helmet off completely he reveals a head
its eyes peacefully
scaly patches and bumps mar the gray skin on its head
as the others stare someone and someone look closely
someone activates probe
she inserts it behind the engineers ear taps a few commands on a tablet waits
holloway lowers his drink as the cells on the engineers change
the engineers eyes twitch and slightly
dark fluid oozes from small holes on either side of his brow and he painfully
as someone activates a conveyor belt carrying the head back to the chamber
the engineers face grimaces and winces the chamber door slides shut and another shot of white mist it
as the mist clears the top of the head explodes splattering the chamber walls with a slime
someone lowers her white doctors mask stares
holloway takes a swig from a bottle and hops down his perch on counter
someone glances after him then lowers gaze
later the storm continues to pelt someone inside someone stands by a pod
he wears the helmet with the visor
he allows a slight smile and bows head
stepping over to the head of the pod
someone touches his palm to its top and a light glowing dims
he removes his helmet and amber visor revealing his expression
now as he strides down corridor
he removes gloves and tosses them into bin
rounding a bend he finds someone waiting him
she steps before him and he slows to stop
she steps closer fixing him with a stare
as someone tries to side step around her she him
they stare at each other only a few apart
she pins him to wall
tensing her jaw someone takes a deep breath through her nose and moves her hand towards someones mouth as if to him
she away
someone approaches a wall of glassdoored coolers filled with supplies one
he removes the urn he took from the chamber
in the lab someone peers through microscope
in the other lab someone gently twists the top off the urn and sets aside
meanwhile with someone a green laser beam aims at slide
on screen a map of the engineers dna overlaps a human sample the scientists drop
meanwhile someone lifts a rack of four large vials from urn
gray ooze drips off the container as he sets it down on a surface
the android breaks off one of the translucent foot vials
as he tips it down
black matter collected at the bottom downward
in the lab someone peers at monitor
now someone breaks off the tip of vial
putting his fingertip over the resulting hole he tips it down
a tiny drop of the black matter sits on the tip of his finger
he lifts it to eye level and peers closely it
smiles
now someone enters the mess hall with a bottle of liquor and sees holloway drunkenly fiddling with balls on the table
the android lifts a glass off a shelf with his thumb and middle finger leaving his index extended
holloway rolls a ball him
holloway shoves back hood
someone stares grimly holloway
holloway smiles up him
keeping his index finger extended someone pours a glass liquor
as he hands it over to holloway he dips his index finger it
holloway takes it with grin
he takes a sip then knocks the whole back
smiles
meanwhile in the tunnels someone and someone come upon a pile corpses
their flashlights illuminate the mangled mass over 10 tall
meanwhile on the bridge the holographic map shows the pups still tracing out tunnels and chambers and someones and someones within
someone stops playing a concertina and approaches a pinging red dot on map
the pinging probe sits motionless at what appears to be a end
in the tunnel someone peers at the map with eyes
watching video of the holographs in her quarters someone speaks into recorder
enters
he sets the rose in a tumbler here
sitting on his lap she him
on a small computer
someone brings up brings up the matching dna graphs then hands it over him
she leans over and hugs him from behind with a smile
she flops down on bed
someone blinks back tears and shakes head
someone adverts her gaze
he tackles affectionately
he her
gazing into her eyes he gives her a tender kiss and rubs chest
someone caresses his cheek then returns kiss
he leans in and they embrace with passion
reaching down someone pulls holloways shirt up his torso revealing his toned back
he straightens and she yanks it impatiently
holloway leans down again and kisses hungrily
now in a slinky black turtleneck and low ponytail someone meanders into cockpit
above the layout table the probe beacons add additional detail to the now enormous map of structure
two yellow beacons someone and someone near ground center
leaning close she reaches toward map
she turns in a corner someone sits concertina
someone returns her gaze to map
someone drums the flat ends of concertina
he sips drink
she pauses as he gets to feet
someone blinks at him and cocks head
someone lifts his persistently
someone looks away then faces him with a smirk
as she marches out someone gazes here
as the storm rages outside someones helmet view shows fluid streaming from urns
they wander chamber
someone exhales smoke in helmet
someone sucks through a plastic hose then blows a puff smoke
someone flips the bird
using a space blanket someone flips back
black fluid streams along ground
a snakelike creature rises from muck
the cockpit empty
as he edges closer it up
someone falls back on his end
he reaches a hand out the creatures head fans out takes the shape of a tail
grinning someone close
he reaches again
the creatures hood wraps around his hand and holds tight
its serpentine body lashes around arm
it snaps his arm like twig
using a knife someone decapitates it it sprays green blood which burns through his acidly
the creatures head regenerates and it burrows up sleeve
it reaches helmet
someone falls face first into the black fluid as he straightens his melting helmet collapses on face
the serpentine creature plunges into someones mouth and forces its way down throat
now from the domes crust we view a golden sun peeking over horizon
silhouetted against the windows of someones quarters holloway hunches over and rubs face
as his partner slumbers peacefully he shuffles to a mirror a light switches on him
facing his reflection he blinks his bleary eyes he takes a few deep breaths then removes a gold ring and sets it on sink
bending over he splashes water over his face and close hair
facing the mirror again he peers at his beady eyes
broken blood vessels redden the rims of irises
holloway knits his brow and leans closer to mirror
he lifts a hand hesitantly then tugs down on the skin beneath eye
clear fluid streams from iris
she touches intercom
now an away team leaves airlock
all but someone board transport
holloway regards suspiciously
as the transport pulls out someone rides beside it on atv
a lone crew member sees them off then twirls his finger in air
later the vehicles approach the gateway
riding behind the transport someone halts and gazes after it as it through
later in structure
the team progresses downhill to a large open doorway shaped like egg
meanwhile someone rides the atv through the tunnels
sipping from a cup
someone monitors him by way of a station
she keeps her back to us her straight blond hair flowing smoothly past shoulders
someone halts the atv with frown
someone removes helmet
his suits camera shares his view as he proceeds down a corridor marked with etchings
he pauses gravely
several yards ahead in a rounded turn a red probe pulsates
with an intense stare he proceeds it
in her lifeboat someone watches the feed projected across windows
as someone progresses we find the probe hovering before a heart shaped door of multiple panels
someone eyes the probe quizzically turns
as someone looks on he enters a code into a panel beside door
it rises and the probe through
as someone ventures forward the doorway shows thousands of urns stacked in giant units
the probe casts its flickering light at the far end of the chamber as the android in
he observes three hourglass formations him
even more urns rest in rows several feet high in recesses cut into the walls
someones screen shows the supply
looking on someone narrows her eyes
crossing the mist enshrouded floor someone arrives at another panel
he operates it successfully and a door rises him
the probes dart past two humanoid figures standing on either side in suits masks
someone shines his light on the corpses
turning ahead he slows his parting
the probe darts out past him as he enters chamber
sarcophaguslike pods lie him
as someone watches from her lifeboat someone cuts off the feed
within the chamber we drift up to find two more giant pods resting opposite their counterparts atop a hundred foot disc marked with a pattern
massive pillars stripe the surrounding walls
someone ventures in dwarfed by the disk
the rest of the away team arrives at the chamber with bust
someone eyes the corpse
behind someone stumbles
they enter the chamber
someone leans over an urn peering closely with flashlight
the team moves through the dark space
as someone stares someone finds a body lying face down in suit
he sits on ground
his skin bears no color the others find someones face green distorted
the serpentine creature leaps out them
it away
leading the team out someone holloway
ducking out collapses
someone ravel
as she goes ravel watches monitors
at the edge of the giant disk someone circles around a curved thronelike chair to a control panel with rows of buttons the size and shape eggs
as he presses a sequence them
they squish beneath his touch like soft rubber
an untouched button on the end pulsates with light within
someone it
the thronelike chair rotates in direction
his flashlight sweeps over a treelike design on the backrest with twin egglike patterns at top
someone climbs on the seat and leans back it
a holographic recording back
showing a helmetless engineer stepping up on disk
someone giddily
someone shines his flashlight at the first who bends over at one of the pods
he gestures to a few others who walk in and circle disc
one continues someone
the android springs from the chair as the engineer takes a seat it
someone cocks head
curiously looking on as the alien rotates the chair to face controls
he picks up a reedlike flute plays
a blue and green holographic sphere rises before pilot
connected to the horse shoe shaped panel by streams of energy
as the pilot works the controls more emerald hued fields of energy appear them
someone lowers a hand
and the energy rises up to connect it
the android climbs up on the disc and crouches studying the panel
in the recording the leader walks over to the pilot and crouches to him
someone listens to exchange
a tremendous threedimensional holographic orb appears over the center of the disc cerulean points of light webbed together within swirl about in patterns
a star system appears in its midst complete with a planet
staring someone approaches the map
higher up smaller spheres with concentric orbital rings revolve around disk
someone steps into the mains sphere and orbital rings appear it
spreading his arms wide the pilot leans back as if playing organ
the main sphere diminishes and darts aside one of the smaller orbs takes its place and grows smiling wondrously in midst
someone looks up and finds a glowing sphere hovering directly him
he spreads his arms wide and turns on spot
the pilot presses more buttons and another orb drifts downward in a net of green beams
reaching up someone catches it lightly in his hand
as he peers curiously at the softly glowing orb we recognize the continent africa
he releases the model of earth letting it float back up again and gazes after ardently
his arms spread someone sways on spot
the recording abruptly out
as someone steadies himself his bewildered gaze lands on the holographic model earth
rotating inches above a translucent coneshaped face the fades
turns
a soft golden glow flickering on face
from within one of the pods an amber fades
aiming his flashlight the android approaches wearily
its ornate translucent lid ends at the head with an eggshaped hatch equipped with handle
someone flashlight beam shines through the barrier revealing an engineer inside
he rests motionlessly with his eyes closed and a breathing mask covering his nose mouth
someone plants a gloved hand and the lid and crouches close to pod
turning his head he leans an ear close it
someones lips curl into a smile
meanwhile the rest of the team boards transport
someone cradles holloway as arrives
discolored bumps on his skin spread darken
the transport open
the crew out
someone strides through the hanger and grabs flamethrower
as the door lowers someone stops halfway down wielding the weapon
collapses
as someone goes to help someone someone
holloway steps toward someone his arms outstretched someone holds someone back someone ignites the flamethrower setting holloway fire
his body completely engulfed holloway drops to his knees someone sobs on ground
as holloways fiery body falls face first and still
someone watches with a expression
someone opens her mouth wide in a grief wail
later wearing a tunic
she sleeps on a wide lit table
a pair of hands reach for cross
and she instinctively grabs them
someone nods gently and she allows him to remove necklace
as he steps away someone lets her arms relax at sides
he puts the cross in jar
he runs a scan of abdomen
someone sits up her slack
she stares wideeyed and her stammer
she scoots off table
she taps buttons on the exam panel
she grips shoulders
her mouth opens wide and she over
someone injects her in the back of shoulder
he lifts her limp body back on to table
as someone shifts to lie on her back someone gazes down her
a tear falls from someones eye and she shakes her head confusion
someones tremble
someone snatches the jar with her necklace and out
someone lying nearly motionless stares up at ceiling
taking a few deep breaths she drifts off sleep
she lies asleep on side
a hand in an oversized yellow glove gives her cheek a few brisk taps someone motionless
as a crewman in a containment suit approaches someone whacks him with a metal object then forward
as the crewman forces her down someone presses up on the plastic covering his face she kicks him off her
as she gets down from the table she falls briefly clutching abdomen
someone races from the room but almost immediately collapses against the wall pain
gritting her teeth she on
someone arrives in the room housing vickers med pod she uses its panel
she selects procedure
as the med pod rotates and tilts into an position
the clear domed lid opens in sections
someone quickly removes her white hospital gown revealing her bandagelike underwear and grabs autoinjectors
she holds one in her mouth as she stabs her thigh with other
she limps over to the med pod and positions herself on the upright table under a scanner
as the two bottom sections of the lid come together like a set doors
the upper section lowers down over patient
someones taut bulges
as the med pod lowers back down someone scoots herself into position she makes a few selections from a touch screen projected over head
the scanner glides over body
a band of green light scans abdomen
as her stomach bulges up normally an image of the alien fetus appears on the screen her
a robotic arm equipped for surgical tools sprays anesthetics across her stomach below her button
three more arms themselves
one of the arms performs a precision cut with laser
someone arches her head back
the muscles in her neck tense as she grits teeth
as the robotic arms on either side of her pry back skin
someones mouth opens wide in a pained someone a large pair of forceps rotates into position at the top of the scanner
as they lower toward her someone gives herself injection
her head relaxes back then tenses again as the forceps dip into her abdomen
the forceps slowly pull the creature out a thick tentacle wiggles inside an eggshaped sac the size of head
relaxing a bit someone lifts her head of the table and slackjawed
the sac brakes open splattering her with bloody fluid and revealing the alien
she quickly grabs the umbilical cord and yanks it out as she makes a selection on the overhead screen the aliens four tentacles spread open and it moves head
gritting her teeth someone watches the robotic arm staple her shut
above her the alien baby wriggles vigorously
flailing its tentacles it tries to free itself from the grip
the med pot starts to tilt upright and someone slams a button her
the lid slowly opens someone scoots down flattening her head to one side it passes under the alien
reaching the end of the table she quickly rushes around to the outer panel
the doors close back up trapping the baby alien inside and a white mist fills chamber
someone sinks to her knees and catches breath
she grabs some more autoinjectors from cart
then watches the baby alien still
she quickly opens the rooms door and hurries out of vickers boat
inside the med pod blood drips from the aliens long eggshaped head as it motionless
now on bridge
a crewman stops halfway down the lowering ramp in a space suit helmet
he cocks his head then moves closer to someone who sits crouched on the ground with his legs bent forward over shoulders
on the bridge someones eyes nervously
the crewman kicks foot
then backs away a few steps he turns to crewmate
someone upright
his smashed open helmet reveals his grotesquely features
the mutant backhands him breaking open helmet
meanwhile someone hurriedly limps down a corridor in the hanger the mutant someone flings wallace to ground
the mutant leaps on wallaces stomach and the crewman spews blood the mutant smashes both fists through his helmet pummeling face
a crewman fires at the mutant who turns his head angrily meanwhile someone turns briefly as she makes her way past a hanging space suit a door to another corridor opens her
meanwhile crewmen fire flamethrowers and guns at mutant
on fire the mutant speedily scales a smooth wall then leaps down tackling a crewman someone and someone stand at the door
two guys fire on the mutant as he flings a third against a transports window as the men escape into a transport the mutant lodges a metal tool into ones back and pulls out
the mutant falls back and the guys run over him with transport
as the vehicle takes off someone and someone arrive dousing the mutant with fire bullets
someone lowers the flamethrower and watches the burn
meanwhile someone gives herself another shot then drops autoinjector
our view rises from her thigh up her bloodspattered body to her face
she peers down a corridor then lowers her hand from a concave wall and shuffles toward a set of doors
she presses a button and the part
she staggers into a room and collapses to knees
a man dressed in white her
then helps her to her feet along with guard
someone notices her well
he quickly takes off his white coat and wraps it around the woman
someone stares at her sitting in wheelchair
he watches as the guard helps her take seat
shivering someone notices the man
someone returns to someone and kneels on floor
he washes the old feet
someone hands someone cane
then helps him put on slippers
someone and the aid help the decrepit old man to feet
someone turns away from someone and his aide readies wheelchair
someone lowers her gaze
now in her cabin she leans over sink
she splashes water on her face then looks over counter
she picks up holloways ring studies it then slides it the ring finger of her hand
gazing thoughtfully she covers mouth
as she sets her hands on the counter we glimpse the line of staples two inches under navel
nodding she glances around then looks over counter
she pops a pill in her mouth then drinks from a glass water
later she puts on her spacesuit and zips up
someone enters the cabin and notices his colleague in her suit
someone returns to the sink and pops pill
someone out
he stops at the door then returns someone
holding her gaze someone steps back and leans against wall
now in someones bedchamber someone stands by as someone works on the back of the old mans suit
doors part for someone and she steps into room
two guards outside
someone and the others step out then the door slides shut leaving someone alone with the man
someone peers her
he sits on bed
she approaches him and he averts gaze
kneeling she caresses hand
someone watches as someone bows head
she rubs her nose over his knuckles and he makes fist
she looks up him
he meets her gaze
she rises to her feet now someone finds someone sitting in the corner of an room
he picks up helmet
meanwhile someone walks down a corridor with someone and his aide behind
stands
she doubles over pain
someone crosses room
now a transport vehicle sets out from the ship leaving a trail of dust in wake
later in the network of tunnels a flashlight shines through the darkness leading team
someone eyes slackjawed
a door rises and someone leads the onward
someone lags behind the only one still wearing her helmet as she shines her flashlight over the urns someone watches a video feed from bridge
someone looks over the urns the captain leaves chair
someone sits at a station
someone stands at the table
a hologram shows the tunnel system without the terrain
an alarmed someone upright
the hologram represents an elaborate crescent shaped vessel with ends
now someone leads the group into the chamber housing the disc
he hops down from the platform then sits in the chair and blows into the flute calling up a orb
crosses disc
he leads them to the pod
someone collapses to her knees pain
someone takes off helmet
someone and someone watch from bridge
someone touches amber lit symbols on pod
opens
someone steps past his aide who lowers gun
as the engineer sits up several tubes detach from his mask
he takes off his headgear and over
as he rises to his feet more tubing detaches standing upright the pale bald titan looks over his visitors
as the engineer crouches someone stumbles but someone and his aide him
the engineer looks someone
the aide strikes someone in the gut with gun
the engineer looks at someone who eagerly waits for reply
he gently lays his hand on the top of head
with both hands he grabs someone by the throat then lifts him off his feet and breaks neck
he rips someones head off and strikes someone with it the aide shoots the engineer and he drops head
the engineer turns someone around and palms her chest knocking her off platform
he strikes the aide flings him into a wall across the chamber then spots someone running away but lets go
someone slows to a stop and braces herself on wall
now someone lies wounded on floor
someones head lies about a away
eyes open the twitches
on the bridge someone watches a video feed showing her fathers rate
she leaves monitor
ravel watches feed
someone looks at his rattled shipmate then lowers his gaze he licks his lips then shifts in seat
someone rubs mouth
now the engineer crouches over the orb
the center of the disc drops then rotates counter clockwise and opens for a head and pillar emerge
someone tries to look in direction
the engineer upright
the rising pillar tilts attached to a base with seat
like a cannon attached to a chair
the engineer faces the imposing device someone him
the gunner rotates
running through a tunnel someone back
as the engineer climbs onto the gunner chair we glimpse someones motionless face profile
the engineer takes a seat then activates the map
a holographic sphere emerges around him and widening outer rings flip place
someone stops to catch breath
as the engineer works the controls a brief flash illuminates his crescent shaped ship a helmet closes him
the helmet shields his face then more armor shields his body smoke blasts from a circle of ports blotting out our view of the underbelly
a torrent of smoke shoots through the tunnel knocking someone off feet
the exhaust hurls her through passage outside
through a window the crew watches thin plumes of smoke rise from ground
as our view retracts through the star map a holographic line sets out from the gunner chair and targets hologram of the earth
amid the flow of exhaust someone grabs hold of a ledge and pulls herself out of a hole in ground
she rises to her feet standing beside one of the erupting plumes she runs for someone but the ground fissures threatening to cut her off from ship
as the gap widens she jumps the fissure and on
we glimpse the ceiling opening up over the crescent ship
running for someone someone jumps another gap but falls short and grabs hold of the ledge
she pulls herself up then finds her path blocked certain
someone glimpses the rising ship then flees the ground
as she dashes across the rocky terrain the massive ship ascends in background
someone stumbles but gets up and takes cover behind a pillar
someone gives his captain an glance
now someone runs through a corridor unzipping her clothes reaching the escape pods she opens a pod door and grabs a suit
blue flames ignite from the engines someone puts on his baseball cap as he takes helm
the four firing engines lift the someone off ground
the crescent shaped ship rotates its blunted ends turning toward the humans vessel as it rises into sky
the lifeboat section ejects from the ship someone readies her suit
the lifeboat lands on the barren terrains smashing a rocky pillar before it slides to stop
on bridge
someone gets in the pod
the pod ejects from ship
someone watches as it loops around and swoops her
touching ground it slides to stop
in the cockpit someone stands at the helm his shipmate seated him
someone rockets towards target
the three shipmates raise their overhead
someones nose pierces the outer wall of the larger ship creating a explosion
as the engineers ship careens a brilliant flashes
followed by an outpouring of smoke someone
someone watches from the ground as someone
the crescent shaped ship turns sideways and descends to ground
one of its blunted ends crash lands before the survivors
huge plumes of smoke and someone billow from the point of impact someone and someone stare at the towering vessel their jaws slack
the crescent shaped ship rolls their way tipping on to the second of its blunted ends someone and someone break into run
the second massive stub crashes into the ground behind them and the ship rolling
as someone and someone desperately try to outrun the trundling vessel fiery chunks of someone strike the ground all them
the rolling ship chases them past a number of rocky pillars dotting the harsh terrain its shadow at heels
someone trips and falls down
as someone keeps running someone looks up at the looming mass then rolls out of way
she rises to her knees and watches someone fall to the ground ahead
flailing on her back someone watches the ships outer wall in
the ship slows to stop
now on its back its blunted aloft
gawking at the towering vessel someone rises to feet
the upright ship begins to tip way
she falls on her rear scurries back toward some jagged rocks then watches one end of the ship come down with no chance escape
as the impact plots out our view we glimpse a burst sparks
someone lies in a pocket left underneath the ship saved by the formation of jagged rocks her
she looks at her wrist then turns on her side and around
she crawls out from under ship
she rises to her feet staggers a few steps then glimpses an expanse of the vessels wall
the engineers ship forms a semicircle her
turning someone sees the lifeboat and staggers over the someone ground
small fires dot field
nearing the craft someone pauses and over
straightening she sways on her feet then perseveres to the compartments open entryway and up
she swings her legs over pushes herself up on all fours and gets to feet
someone stumbles to a touchscreen control panel and works it with hands
a pair of doors slides shut behind her sealing inside
she packs supplies from shelves
someone halts turns
her eyes wide she looks over her shoulder at doors
facing forward she reaches into low tool compartment and takes out a fire ax with a handle
doors ahead open revealing the devastated remains of quarters
on the far end the false windows show the video of the little girl playing violin
broken hoses tubes and wires dangle from the ceiling panel surrounding chandelier
someone shovels in removes her helmet and sets aside
sparks rain down erratically from the ceiling as she ventures past the bar her axe ready and approaches doorway
pausing at its threshold she raises the axe and gazes down a brief passageway ending in a sealed door with two windows
she hesitantly
breathing through nostrils
wet with condensation the doors windows show the med pod moving on its own in the light
someone leans her face close to the glass through
as we watch her from the other side we find blood smearing door
a giant tentacle slaps against the glass someone backs away her mouth hanging open in a stare
the tentacle rubs persistently against the window then slides down glass
as someone turns the remaining engineer forces a pair of side doors open and through
charging he backs her against wall
she pounds a touchscreen a tentacle shoots out through the med pod station doors lashes around the engineers throat and tackles him taking someone down them
as the creature wraps its tentacles around the engineer she wriggles out from beneath both
a spare tentacle wraps around her ankle but she kicks it lose and away
the creature lifts the engineer off floor
grabbing her helmet someone rushes back to the compartment
in the lifeboat the engineer struggles pitily against the grasp of the giant creature
flaps on its underside blossom outward like petals revealing eggshaped buds surrounding a vertical mouth lined with teeth
the engineer braces his legs against the frame
someone opens the air locked doors with her back and hand then jumps out and lands in a roll
in the lifeboat the engineer snarls at the creature pulling him closer
yet another tentacle reaches out and wraps around head
the buds shoot out tendrils that lash around his skull and hold still
the mouth launches a serpentine appendage down the throat
it pulls him close then lowers itself on top him
the giant squidlike creature wriggles around completely covering prey
it eventually relaxes and still
outside the sun peeks through thick rolling clouds someone weeps on back
on the disc someones sweats
outside someone lifts head
grimacing painfully someone up
her gaze darts to a wrecked atv halfburied in a mound dirt
in the ship light wavers on someones face
he uncertainly
the atv kicks up dust as someone drives it over the uneven terrain toward the engineers ship
she steps into its cockpit
light erratically
a few feet from his head someones body twitches someone steps closer and looms over coldly
someone puts down her bag and removes her protective helmet
crouching at the androids body she rummages around and finds cross
gazing tenderly at it someone gently straightens chain
she solemnly puts it on over head
and gives a sigh
looking on someone admiringly
someone crouches over head
the android stares at her with parted lips he clamps his shut
now someone uses a line and pulley to lower someones body out of an opening in the hull
his head lies on the floor by her feet gazing up at placidly
the body touches gently
someone picks up his head in both hands someone gives her a childlike appreciative smile as she lowers him into bag
the wind musses hairline
someone zips the bag closed over his gaze
wincing painfully she gets to her feet and hauls the up
from the edge of the hull she repels 20 feet to ground
the atv travels away from the structure along the valley
it approaches the structure
now we ascend clouds
an engineer ship rises view
flaring brilliantly it away
beyond the clouds the ringed planet glows fade black
in the abandoned lifeboat the last engineers body convulses on the floor surrounded by the creatures tentacles
in the flickering pulsating light his bulges
an exoskeletal point resembling giant
claw bursts out and slices through sternum
a skinny body with long limbs in a gleaming dark gray exoskeleton wriggles out of the hole and onto floor
a yellow amniotic sac pulsates it
connecting the newborn to the carcass
the new alien specimen pushes itself up on all fours it lifts its head which bears the oversized claw like growth as a sickle shaped crest
the alien straightens sitting up on its heels and around
it works its jaws
a set of inner jaws pops out from its mouthits pink gums slime
the thieves out
someone leads someone and someone toward distant
someone hands her arrow
as the youngster keeps watch as his cohorts escape then leans back fires
the flaming arrow arcs through the air lands
he defiantly tips his head back then runs out gate
someone halts by the barn her statuesque features sullen inside grain spills from a dangling sack
now light flickers on another calligraphy parchment king someone the lion heart bankrupt of wealth and glory is floundering his way back to england after ten years on crusade

her gaze darts as she arches her brow affecting an air indifference
the archer stands stiff as she unbuttons a clasp at this throat she lays the ends of the chain mail hood on shoulders

she gives a mocking curtsy then storms off shoving her fingers in mouth
ahead of her she trots upstairs with her skirts up
inscrutably then glances at the fire and bites his lower lip he picks up someones sword and eyes the inscription on the hilt until lambs become lions later he treads into someones bed chamber warm light flickers on a hefty four poster bed curtains separate it from a sitting area in front of a fireplace where someone tosses bedding to the floor and eyes the haughtily
she gestures at the bedding then strides to the curtains toward bed
she whips the curtains shut and someone plods over to the bedding with dogs
someone lights candle
someone glances at the curtains back lit by the candle the sheer fabric offers a thinly veiled view of someone stepping out of her dress someone lies down in front of the fire and pets a wolf hound lying next to him resting his head on his hand he looks to the curtain someones silhouette pulls another layer off over her head leaving her clad only in her chamois someone politely rolls onto his back and looks away now the bare branches of towering trees sway against the sky someone leaves a camp and prowls into the woods
a figure rises from the darkness moonlight gleaming on his conical helm he and someone hike the short distance toward other
the frenchman smirks and steps to someones side and gestures toward forest
dozens of armed french soldiers appear in the mist and head toward them daytime in a dove cote a shaggy bird keeper as they flutter away he one

now at twilight carts of grain make their way along a narrow road through the woods guards
upon a hooded figure with a bow

hanging from a someone
merry men ride off with grain
shuffle along with tiny steps now puffy clouds reflect the moonlight casting a gentle glow on nottinghams fields as the merry men plot to reclaim the grain in slow motion someone marches down a row of furrowed soil tossing seed by the handful from a sack slung over shoulder
other patch of soil someone drizzles grain from his fingertips little someone works beside someone who wears a grin
turning on the spot as rain begins to fall upon the fields it starts gently then quickly gathers force as lightning overhead
someone sits by the hearth in the banquet hall a fiery glow illuminating her noble features as she gazes downward at her feet someone sleeps on the floor in an undershirt a blanket covering him from the waist down wakes
she crouches beside someone and draws the blanket up over his shoulder under his tender stare her warm fades
form silhouetted against the fire her gaze lingers on someone as she sidles away she turns her back to him and strides across the great hall her arms swinging stiffly at her sides he watches from the floor as she pauses her fair skin resplendent in the glow of a moonlit window she glances back toward someone with parted lips then continues out now as legions of soldiers march double time through woods

toward his shaving mirror studying his reflection

now someone rides into the charred ruins at barnsdale the intricately carved stone cross stands unharmed in the deserted village center someone stares at it as he rides closer the archer dismounts and his men suit

dropping his eyes to the ground he crouches and plants one hand in mud
someone lifts face

inside someone watches newscast
she remembers riding in the back of an suv in korea with someones concerned gaze fixed her

surface someone brings someone cellphone
he dives over the edge with open arms and falls into the abyss
he lowers phone
it shines in through the aperture

they each continue their descent at forward base someone someone
someone releases virgil into the pool and the robot sets off after diver
he watches them underwater
a pale flashlight shines over the darkened rocks as a diver emerges from a passage

he struggles through the tunnel
he follows close behind her rebreather also removed from back
he works joystick
he flippers as she forward
as she pushes her rebreather its pack snags on rock
someone continues on and follows
now in an area enveloped by darkness a beam of light shines out its radius growing larger as someone emerges from the tunnel into cavern
a wall below the tunnel as someone emerges behind him someone anchors a guide line to the wall
someone shines flashlight
pointing his finger he swirls it in circle
someone heads back to tunnel
as she sucks in a mouthful water
and then her jerks
virgil glides over to someone who turns peering out at someone from monitor
he squeezes his eyes shut someone watches the monitor with a grave look and someone shifts his away

he tilts his alertly
someone takes lead
at forward base someone sits in front of the monitor swigging from his bottle sweeping his gaze around the cave he wipes his mouth the back of his hand then picks up a flashlight he glides his beam up a wall to a crevasse in rock
someone joins him sitting in front of the monitor he eyes the onscreen footage of st judes cathedral where virgils light shines up a towering shaft toward the rippling surface of the bell
someone drinks from the bottle
meanwhile someone stops at a station
leaks through cracks raining into the cave someone around
someone and someone look up the shaft with headlamps
his companions gravely
someone around
someone tearfully bares teeth
he looks his son in the eye and gives a nod
looking up someone notices the boulder sealing off exit
on the upper edge blows out shooting sparks and leaving the falls darkness
someone pants in an agonized someone later the team arrives back at the dark flooded camp
packs
someone rushes to a floating body bag and gently pulls it open to reveal someone face
someone watches he remove the dead wetsuit
she folds her arms across her chest and stubbornly plants feet
someone gravely looks from her someone
searching the area for supplies someone heads around a large flowstone feature and halts two motionless legs float him
pulling him into the light someone finds someones face pulverized recognition
the opens
someone over
he crouches by his gravely colleague
someone queasily away
someone drags away
someone drags back
the injured man wraps an arm around his shoulder
then pushes against his throat maintaining his hold the older man bites lip
someones hand grabs his shoulder again flexes weakly and limp
now underwater we peer up at four pairs of legs silhouetted against the light above the surface there feet clad in flippers they lazily tread water back at the large flowstone feature someone crouches over his friend
now we float up toward the lazily legs
he lowers goggles
as their headlamps descend the cave dark
now someone leads the way through the narrow passage leading to the restriction
someone swims into view pulling at the rocks beneath him his father takes his hand places it on the guide line and gives the okay signal someone returns the gesture his father swims on leading him through the passage
someone passes the chamber
from a distance we watch the team of divers recede into the depths
a light on her rebreather pack green
while someone soberly looks on someone goes next shoving his gear in him
the restriction and swims in after it left alone someone worriedly shakes her head and away
someones flippered feet paddle out view
effort she pushes her gear into restriction
ahead shimmering green light grows visible from around bend
her eyes wide behind her goggles up ahead someone pushes himself through the exit his father hovers in st judes cathedral waiting him
ahead someone joins franks someone and someone outside the exit
with her fists in the cathedral someone faces worriedly
the others continue to wait in line
grabs hold and jerks at it outside the tunnel the exit shows no sign of her approach someone taps his boss on the shoulder as someone faces him he points at his own eyes then at the restriction someone shakes his head wags a finger then swims toward the himself
a headlamp beam appears from darkness
someone turns to look as someone crawls view
he swims forward someone rubs arm
then jerks his thumb upward now a beam of light shines toward the rippling surface of the air above
someone removes mouthpiece
on to the rocky bank he pulls of an elastic band strapping a flashlight to his arm and turns on his helmets light
drips from his wetsuit as his lamp sweeps over the cavern with an awestruck smile he forward
the pool next and finds the financier wandering out view
the young man climbs up on an underwater ledge and raises his feet
hiking over a ridge someone finds a vast cavernous passageway ascending him
dwarfed to a minuscule size by surroundings
and someone covers her with the metal tissuethin blanket
he sits him down and hands him a rebreather someone puts it to his mouth stepping away someone reaches into his supply pack and pulls out a knife with a six blade
someone grimly switches off his helmet lamp so someone
now someone wakes up from nap
someone rubs someones foot as she sits under the blanket
a veiny red discoloration on his left pack as someone whispers to himself eyes closed someone sits him
someone breaks off muttering and opens his eyes shivers
she flashes a meek smile someone confers someone
the six inch knife in the ground is almost submerged
now we drift over a rippling subterranean pond as the group crosses a cavern as big as a stadium
someone steps out from behind a pitch black wall and shines his helmet light across a rocky passage water rains down lightly inside the sleek space
someone climbs over a rock barrier carrying a yellow bag
just footsteps behind follows
someone comes next someone
bringing up the rear someone stops and adjusts his helmet light someone looks back at his hesitant friend who makes a fist and on
rocky partition and peers down a fairly spacious passageway his helmet light striking the rainlike mist he then sidles to his right and trains his light beam down a tunnel
someone marches on saddled with gear stumbles
someone continues up incline
they share a grin and someone leads ahead
someones gaze grows mildly sullen distant
as someone eyes him squarely someone deflects the order with a smirk
he looks at more shimmering blood on his palm and makes fist
he closes his eyes nods
someone continues on wearing a bulky white rebreather on back
on a ledge above them someone hauls up gear
arrives
someone and someone go looking him
someone leads the way into another den
a crude carving reads george here
blood trails from mouth
light from his partners helmet dwindles on the man
the last of the light fades out leaving us in darkness
now someone snaps photographs of the walls
someone sits on a nearby
as someone returns with his camera someone him
someone hands supplies up to father
someone looks uncertainly
his father leaves someone who sits wincing
a mildly defiant grin fades from someones face someone rubs neck
a slackjawed someone drops his hand on lap
he looks at someone who sadly gazes at the floor someone squeezes someones shoulder then leaves side
someone fixes the collar of his vest and hangs head
now someone marches alone through another cavern his helmet light shines over a winding path through the uneven rock floor someones light shines about 50 yards ahead
someone appears just it
the veteran caver peers through the opening into another darkened chamber he sets down his yellow bag
catch up and set down their own gear as someone crawls through the opening his helmet light dims out he holds his hand before it to verify someone and rest
walls bears some irregularities someone spots a ledge and opening across cauldron
out of the trickling chamber someone peers it
someone blows on hands
someone someone
later in the cauldron chamber someone hangs from a rope and harness the others watch him through the hole
he goes to another below
water rains down on him someone feeds out slack
to some coiled rope on his hip the young man scans the walls
down at the churning pool gets a hold on the wall and leans out far under a waterfall
someone gives him some more slack and someone repositions himself on ledge
he extends his left foot to another crag about three away
he feeds him a few more inches someone finds a secure position and studies wall
he keep kimself onto ledge
water splashes below
someone looks up from the below
someone and someone on the side
someone shines a flashlight her
now as someone coils a handful of rope he glances at someone who stares off with a stunned gaze his head propped on hand
someone shoots someone a disbelieving glance someone sets down his ropes and looks across way
his son sits on a ledge his mouth set in a line and his eyes staring blankly someones heaves
someone glares him
tears stream down cheeks
his hardens
someone away
someones furrows
someone meets his gaze and it
he sits on a ledge below joshs resting his hands on knee
he shifts eyes
under his fathers steady gaze someones chin trembles his face contorts anguish
someone moves to his sons ledge and crouches he places a hand on shoulder
he rubs cheek
pulling someone close he him
squeezes his shut
someone glares at the father son
shifting his jaw someone away
he meets his fathers gaze nods
someone stumbles as he makes his way over the ground
trudging past stalagmites he and someone find an underwater cave on the opposite side of the chamber at the waters edge someone bends at the waist resting his hands on legs
as they stare at the dark water someone them
he scans the submerged cave then takes off his bag and lets it fall to ground
he dives into water
as someone swims around a corner in a narrow passageway someone catches up and grabs on to leg
but finds the cave ceiling above holding underwater
his hands feeling for a break in rock
someone eyes the surface
path of light pierces the darkness at the caves entrance and he swims it
his own headlamp off his helmet and replaces it with sons
someone shifts his eyes
someone off
someones lips spread into a smile and nods
he gives a grin
someone away
pushing out his jaw he gives a thoughtful look then abruptly shifts his gaze to a section of the caves wall near someone he stands sniffing air
someone watches his son head to an eyelevel cavity in the rockreaching inside someone touches a dark muddy substance then lifts his fingers to nose
smiling he turns to his father and smears some of the sludge on his cheek someone up
he joins someone by cavity
self into hole
later he and someone climb a narrow gap between two rock faces pressing their backs to one and gripping the other with their hands feet
lifting his foot someone finds hold
someone grabs a piece of rock
someone straightens pushing higher
someone rests his back on rock
he leans against arm
drops of water splash against their helmets someone turns to his father and meets his gaze with a grin
he blinks against the falling water his chest heaving as his sons light glows on his face someone looks away swallows
he climbing
the climbers lights as they ascend the chimney
his body to bridge gap
with a hand gripping each rock face someone steps on to his thigh
body and grabs a ledge someone grits his teeth as someones weight bears down him
someone pulls himself onto ledge
the light on someones helmet torch out
he checks for his lights reflection on palm
someone lifts his hand to the light on his own helmet and switches off
darkness envelopes climbers
now someones helmet light emerges from darkness illuminating the walls of a tunnel as he crawls it
follows without a light his figure disappearing in the blackness behind father
ahead the walls of the tunnel widen and the ceiling slightly
as someone moves forward his light out
he turns on his wristwatchs light and it glows on his determined face holding its button down he creeps forward no longer crawling but crouched under the ceiling
he stumbles then winces and walking
someone pauses beside him and someone shoots him glance
he lowers himself to the ground and leans against the tunnels wall then releases the button for his light
as someone lifts his hand a trace of light reflects on his palm fingers
he shifts his gaze someone
someone looks at his son his profile traced in a glimmer of light the climber stare down the tunnel where more light gleams of its walls
daylight bathes their faces as they emerge from a fissure and step into cavern
at its center a brilliant shaft of sunlight glows down through a hole in its ceiling
as they walk toward it someone removes helmet
someone removes his helmet as well and his father lifts his face to the hole insects flutter around the sunbeam
above ground vegetation lines the perimeter
someone lowers his gaze from the natural skylight and notices a weathered military vehicle sitting it
someone climbs on to tank
he peers down its hatch straightens
rain falls on someones face as he up
leaps off the tank landing in soft muddy ground together he and someone crouch and examine some remains
later a view through the skylight shows towering trees below a cloudy sky pale light glimmers raindrop
as they fall into the cavern squatting someone fills a container with oil from the tank then looks over at someone who strikes a flint under the shelter of a wheel well he lights a makeshift torch grins
as someone rises with his flaming cylindrical container in hand someone shoves fabric into the top of his own container
someone lights his fathers torch with his own and they lift them as toasting
with a thoughtful frown someone glances at father
now a wide view shows pale light shining through the hole casting the cavern in a glow
holding his makeshift torch someone glances around and follows his son into a tunnel as the light from his flame disappears our view glides to writing etched in the side of the tank frank and someone were here ya
later orange light from someones torch flickers on the rock walls as he leads his father through the tunnel it widens and he climbs down a ledge his eyes squinting into a chamber
smiling he crouches beside a body water
slipping someone slides down the ledge on rear
someone over
someone rises and someone shifts his helmet as his son follows river

someone shrugs with resignation shaking his head at the cave walls he dives into the pool disappears
someone stares him
his fathers side someone drops to his knees and cradles his head in hand
grimaces
someone lowers him into pool
gently supports head
someone lies flat buoyed by water
sobbing someone shakes head
as someones hand grips his sons arm someones tremble
meanwhile in the underwater cave someone illuminated by the green light of the glow stick feels his way along the rocks above with teeth
emerging in open water he does a breaststroke toward murky
back in the cave the oil candles flame slowly extinguishes leaving the area darkness
break in half bathing everything in a green glow he sets the stick aside as his father shivers in water
nods slowly someones pursed lips form a brief smile
he sets jaw
someone lays his forearm below someones chin and gently pressure

someone looks down at him parted
he withdraws his hand from his fathers letting it fall back into murk
someones right hand halfrises from the cloudy water sliding his hand from his fathers forehead someone lifts his body to surface
under the green illumination of the glow stick the young man blinks sadly
with one hand pressed to his fathers chest someone bends down and plants a tender kiss on forehead
he rises drawing his arms back and allows his fathers body to away
now underwater someone emerges from a cavern clutching a glow stick and the cylinder
rise from the valve as he raises it to his lips and takes hit

now someone arrives at a crevasse
he takes another hit from the tank then on
further on someone stares resolutely forward as he feels his way along jagged
glow stick out

with his cheeks puffed out he edges his way up along a jutting wall rock
these bubbles emerge from small craters someone crawls over and presses his lips one
from above someones face breaks the surface
inhales deeply from another bubble
a distant bluish light expands and shines across the big shape of body
wincing he resubmerges with a shake of head

the image dissolves to someone as she opens the fan to the many columns of chinese lettering in folds
someone gazes thoughtfully at message
then shuts the fan and touches it to chin
she dreamily closes eyes
as she gently presses the fan to her cheek the image fades black

someone lowers her disapproving gaze to bowl
the butcher slurps down his tea in gulp
as he leaves the table someone gets up and follows him to doorway
he looks past his wife someone
who lowers her gaze
later in the dark the welltodo guest lies in a humble bed her open
someone hesitantly rolls over and leans her head over the edge of bed
light filtering between the floor boards glows on her features
she leans a little further to below
in the room beneath her the shirtless butcher lies on top of someone thrusts
she clings to him tightly her eyes closed and her parted
someone them
someones hand gently caresses her back
someone returns to her shadowy bed and rolls over to face ceiling

someone lets her hand drift up to her face
her fingertips awkwardly touching her skin as they trail down her throat
her other arm crosses her chest she gathers the blanket up close to chin
in the present day someones feet slip off a pair of black highheeled shoes and rest on a carpet
one bare foot rubs the ankle
someones hand reaches down and massages foot
she lifts it up across knee
and gently caresses the backs of toes
her soft downturned gaze remains fixed on the moment selfcare
her gaze distant
in the butchers house her 19th century counterpart sleeps curled up in the bed
she stirs awake and around
the noblewoman sits up her long hair loose around shoulder
she peers down toward the lower floor then shifts her puzzled gaze and up

revealing her tiny bound foot still wrapped bandages
she massages her big toe winces
as she sits up someone strokes hair
someone strokes her shoulder
now the refugee women sit huddled around campfire
seated close to each other someone and someone stare into the flames with expressions
they sing
a couple of small white flakes drift down above
a few more dart past carried by wind
the two friends stop singing and up
they share a grave look then lean over and adjust the blankets covering the children at feet
someone observes someones attention to her sons and rubs her appreciatively
the two women share a tender look and someone takes hand
at dawn the snow falls heavily on camp
someone someone and her children lie huddled together under heavy blankets near the mouth of cave
the butcher returns and tethers the cow to tree
he finds his young son on the end without his share of covers
the father dusts snow off the childs clothes and adjusts the blanket to him
patting the boys hand pauses
the father lays a hand on his sons head then touches face
the child unresponsive
the butcher lowers the blanket and cranes his face close to boys
the father sits back on knees
he hefts the boys limp body and rocks him in arms
as he gets to his feet his sons head rolls back limply and one arm dangles from grasp

someone reaches out cradles her face in hand
and gently lifts head
someone absently meets her laotongs loving gaze then back
her melancholy face falling out view
someone looks mournfully
in the present someone lies draped over someones bed
sleeping with her hand over some of the pages
daylight from the windows accentuates her pale complexion as slumbers
a few stray wisps of her black hair obscure her face
which rests on her own arm
her jackets hangs slung over her backrest
and her right hand clutches a few pages
the rest of the stack lies on someones lap
someone on
nearby a monitor tracks her vitals
at night in car
staring off she shifts her attention to the traffic ahead and pulls her forward
now we gaze at a shanghai freeway from distance
the tightlypacked headlights shine brightly beneath the sky
beyond them a vast mass of skyscrapers stands darkened
now in club
a girlish singer in a slinky black dress leaves the stage and flirts with patrons on the floor
on the periphery a ruggedly handsome man of anglo descent sports close cropped hair and a suit
he finds someone on a love seat where a man with a grey beard awkwardly fails to chat her
a goldframed oil portrait hangs upside down them
the handsome sits
the greybearded playboy gives a disappointed shake of the head leaves
the handsome man offers someone a brief smile
she lowers her gaze
someone leans forward his demeanor stoic polite
she hesitantly meets his tender gaze
she looks remorsefully
now traffic passes outside hospital
inside someone uneasily
someone stands close by in corridor
she takes a breath
someone studies his expression then bows her demurely
someone crosses to someones door opens it and through
someone paces in the hall then peers him
the welldressed man shuffles to the bed and sinks down on edge
his hands rest on his knees as slouches
looking down at the woman
someone reaches an arm across her legs and rests his hand on the side
someone turns away putting her back to the corridor wall and heavily
now someone and someone sit side by side munching corn on cob
they watch tv and magazines
words appear six earlier
someone reaches for her friends chest and her
someone wrenches away then playfully smacks head

in slinky party dresses they someone to the music and swivel their hips as drink
someone flips her long hair and sidles closer to her laotong her eyes closed in pout
someone tosses her hair over her shoulders and tilts her back
later they sip shots
now in a back room someone sits back in a plush chair and kicks off her heels
as she settles in someone saunters over with a liquor bottle in one hand a drink in other
she sets the bottle down and sits next to her friend
someone regards her with smile
they clink glasses and sip the clear drinks
someone gently pushes her friends head away glares
now at a fancy dinner club someone stands in the spotlight before band
sharing a table sebastian and applaud
dancing couples take to floor
as an amused someone and sebastian watch from their distant table someone crosses the floor
someone arrives at a table and points at occupant
sinking down to a chair he sits close to someone and sings her
she adopts a pout
then brushes her hair back and faces him with a coy hint of smile
at their table sebastian goodhumoredly
a stunned someone looks uneasily
chuckles
as someone leans in someone away
she raises her fingers to her lips shifts her coquettish gaze and grants him a kiss
someone sets down his mic takes someones hand and leads her to the dance floor where he yanks her close
as someone stares tensely someone seizes the club owners head and pulls him into a long kiss

his hand drifts to her waist then slips down her slinky dark dress
he caresses her bottom
someone takes a strained breath and bows head
later someone saunters down a hallway
someone her
now facing a mirror someone dabs tinted gloss on her full lips then smiles herself
she leaves the restroom to find someone outside
someone stares at her with disbelief then shakes head
someone withdraws gently her softening
someone marches down the hallway her head bowed someone stares her
she away
shifting her increasingly gaze
she sets her stubbornly
back at the butchers house in the century
someone opens a heavy pair of doors
then accompanies someone as she shuffles out with a expression
someone sighs gravely her face bruised
her laotong motionless
someone faces her and takes hand
her friend doesnt look her
someones eyes heavily
so much has happened in the years we apart
someone listens with a gentle gaze her head tilted to side
someone gives a solemn nod
then looks down at their hands
someone shuffles around to her
hand in hand they leave doorway
someone displays a scowl
someone halts her knitted
someone stares at her then timidly works her lips
someones chest heaves and she lowers gaze
she leads her laotong onward with a expression
beyond the open gate the noblewomans servants ready palanquin
someone affectionately strokes her arm
there are things about men you someone know
there are matters you do understand
someone abruptly turns away and marches through gate
follows
the rebels have stopped
she pauses at the threshold gazing out over countryside
eyes glistening someone faces her imploringly
someone clasps hands with her and looks uncertainly toward palanquin
someone slowly turns and looks her
she takes a deep breath then gently withdraws her hands from someones grasp
the noblewomans eyes glisten but she gives an accepting nod and bows head
now someone and three other women sit at the side of a river beating wet clothes clubs
someone glances at her then shakes head
she and the other woman wring out garment
someone takes another sopping wet of
she takes a deep breath as a breeze blows wisps of hair across face
she raises her club and beats the stoically
now at the someone house yang gong helps someone downstairs to a foyer where the woman from someones waits
someone reluctantly reaches into the folds of clothing
my sister asked me to return this you
she holds the folded fan out to noblewoman
someone takes it and studies it with a brow
someone gives a troubled frown as she peers at it over her shoulder
someone turns the fan in her hands her heaving
she looks up at someone with eyes
avoiding her gaze
the messenger apologetically bows head
her features set in a dazed expression someone away
someone reaches for her but the noblewoman wrenches her arm out of her grasp and climbs the alone
now in a space
she opens the fan in a shaft of gentle light reads
three sworn sisters in jintian have promised to love me as am
you need not worry about anymore
now steam rises from bowls of food on table
someone steps into view her head jutting forward and her arms at sides
she pauses by a window and outward
clutching the fan in one hand she raises it to her waist and rests it on her palm
she stares off with a dazed expression
silhouetted against a window she hard
then slowly doubles over and grasps a chair at the head of table
she sinks down turning her back to us as she rests her head against hand
the fan drops from grasp
now in her apartment someone continues reading manuscript
she sets one page aside and peruses the next with eyes
a tear rolls along the side of her nose and another streams down cheek
several fans covered in writing sit on an open bundle of plain cloth
someone sits slouched at table
while someone stands in nearby
the noblewoman waves feebly at fans
she bundles up the fans and carries away
someone sits motionless as gentle firelight glows on her face
in a gathering room several women sit around a table with a bright red cloth
words appear six later
the gathered women sew and enjoy refreshments as sing
one nods and smiles to someone who apart
the noblewoman politely returns the gesture and makes an effort to along
arrives
she grimly away
someone lifts her gaze her eyes shining as someone comes in with her sisters
an older speaks
thank you for traveling all this way to celebrate our wedding
someone humbly bows head
the mother of cousin yan gestures to a row of chairs and the sit
someone watches her estranged laotong with eyes
someone keeps her gaze fixed downward
avoiding everyone stare
someone resumes song
someones gaze drifts cautiously in direction
her estranged laotong stares at the floor her jaw tight
a servant arrives with a tray of refreshments and serves newcomers
someones shoulders heave slowly beneath her gown
moving hesitantly she ventures a look at someone through her eyes
her old friend down
responding to her gregarious jintian sisters with faint smiles nods
someone averts her wounded gaze stands
the bride her mother and a few other guests take notice as she shuffles past table
someone pauses turning her face slightly in direction
she continues onward leaving party
now someone wanders into the 19th century room
she stops turns
across the room someone alone
she raises her head slowly and looks someone
the contemporary woman regards sadly
from across the room the two women of different eras hold each gaze
now traffic proceeds down a narrow street
at the gallery someones aunt walks someone through the exhibit on chinese binding
large square black and white photographs of bare mutilated feet cover wall
now a plain brown highrise stands crowded among similar buildings beneath an sky
an old woman in a bath robe leads someone up a stairway
they proceed down a hallway with paint
they pass rows of frosted glass windows then arrive at an apartment with shoddily whitewashed walls
the leaves
someone steps through the doorway into the apartment and pauses to take in her surroundings with a expression
heading further in she passes a mirror dotted with stickers photographs
exposed wiring drapes across the crumbling walls
someone passes a halffinished painting on easel
then a low unmade bed tucked in corner
later she sits at a desk littered with several stacks of books manuscripts documents
someone flips through the pages of a small spiral notebook
we drift closer to her and find her lips slightly pursed as reads
in the notebook a pen and ink sketch depicts a delicate tree amidst a landscape
on the opposite page an illustration shows light from an oncoming train shining brightly from a tunnel
someone turns to the page
and finds it filled writing
near the back cover she discovers a folded letter addressed her
we see someone sitting in a red tinted bathtub she sinks down slowly under water
back at the desk shutting notebook
she notices a photograph tucked beneath the scattered pages of a manuscript draft she pulls out
it features her and someone as teenagers clad in their matching red suits
someone looks up at him and nods her chest heaving beneath her black coat
someone stares at her then averts his gaze
someone looks up at him her eyes wide shining
someone gives a stoic nod then away
his handsome features set in a frown
he gently leads onward
now sitting on her bed at home someone removes the gray mens suit jacket from the bag
the finelytailored garment unfolds gracefully as she holds up
standing she puts on
she wraps it tightly around her slender torso and hugs it close over chest
her head droops forward and her eyes close as she strolls over to a window
she sways dreamily on her feet then lifts her head and slips her hands into the pockets with a sigh
looking down she pulls out a small brass key with a toggle
and a small round coil
someone frowns quizzically as she turns it in fingertips
now a pair of woodframed glass doors bear stenciled characters
reversed letters beneath read bath
someone steps through doors
she crosses a waiting area and approaches a desk
his locker number 173
the burly bathhouse attendant stops eating and listens with a brow
were not open yet theyre cleaning
leading her into a room he turns to worker
the worker stops spreading towels over loungers leaves
someone gives a tiny bow and the man returns gesture
she waits as he off
she makes her way to a bank of wooden lockers and skims her gaze over numbers
she slides the key into its lock and pulls open door
she finds a modest shrine in memory of father
a rectangular wooden plaque upright
bearing the mans photo and a panel of writing
a few blue silk roses and pieces of citrus it
someone lifts a folded fan of the shelf
she opens it spreading its creased paper panels and finds writing on one
flipping it over she sees writing on only half of the panels
she blinks her sad eyes and closes fan
her gaze falls on something else in the locker and she tilts her head for a look
on the bottom shelf she finds a stack of pages
taking them out she reads the cover page snowflower and the fan
someone flips to the next page reads
her intent eyes fixed on her friends manuscript
the end of this story is about things of the heart that someone change
within the story a girl stands in the doorway of home
as someone leads someone over the girl enters and drops to knees
my mother is sick
she calls for you in sleep
someones eyes fill tears
gazing up at her someones daughter woefully
a tear slides down cheek
someone kneels down to girl
but she has sisters
she has no other sisters she you
she never had laotong
for ten years she was only teacher
she has only one sister of heart
the girls face crumbles in sobs as she grabs hands
someone averts gaze
someone gazes sadly
now in a modest bedroom someone lies on a sleeping platform with her hands folded on chest
three women at her leave
as someone enters someones eyes closed
someone hobbles to the bed
her gaze fixed on her laotong
she pauses by feet
then closer
she lowers herself to the edge of the platform and leans someone
brow creased someone stares down at her sister
someone blinks then looks at someone through half eyes
someone clutches her dying hand
tears spill from eyes
she gently squeezes someones fingers as she gazes at the woman
now someone lies down beside someone on bed
she stretches her arm over her friend and holds gently
someone and someones daughter stand just outside the door
someone finds a closed fan in basket
someone opens it revealing the columns of handpainted characters on panels
she flips it over and gazes at the halffilled span of back panels
someones bearded husband nearby
watching his wifes laotong with a gaze
later in someones bedroom golden light shines through windows
casting a warm glow on face
she gazes at someone who lies peacefully by with her eyes closed and her hands folded on stomach
now someone leans over sister
letting her face hover just inches someones
she extends her trembling fingers and rests them upon her cheek
now tears shine in someones eyes as she stares off with a expression
when someone returned home after funeral
she looked at the fan and could not allow things to end as had
so she opened a panel
dipped her brush and wrote a inscription
as a tear runs down cheek
she calmly works a bamboo stylus on a panel of the fan
leaving several characters in ink
in the present someone reads the manuscript page with eyes
still clutching the fan
she lowers the sheet of paper and off
an aerial view focuses on gleaming traffic and crowded lanes
the world is changing
every day changing
everything in life changing
we have to look inside ourselves to find what stays same
a view of a bustling sidewalk shows two girls walking arm arm
in a park elderly women sit together on bench
shanghai skyscrapers jut into the sky
at home facing a window someone holds the fan and traces characters with her fingertip on the pane
someone gazes out into a balcony where she imagines someone and someone at a table doing together
their 19th century attire contrasts with shanghais modern skyline them
the women smile as stitch
someone glances at laotong
then shifts her gaze someone
she opens her mouth speak

then closes her fingers it
she covers someones hand with own

in the highceilinged modern facility a slender woman with short curly hair swivels in chair
she raises her arms as a message flashes on her screen disconnected
the 911 operator locks her hands behind her head and leans back in chair
looking at her computer she exhales deeply and sets her down
she types unit on scene 1348 hours then answers an call
she tilts her head smiles

a man reaches into the broken window as someone goes to the stairs someone rapidly types on computer
the intruder walks down the upstairs hall and opens one of the doors as it swings shut behind him the dark ominous figure stands frozen in a vestibule with an entry
he goes to the archway and briefly surveys the room before kneeling at the foot of bed
catching sight of his reflection in mirror
the prowler walks up to an open door
he slowly pulls it closed as he checks it
his face obscured by a ball cap the menacing man turns he heads toward a beaded curtain and it
he returns to the vestibule and closes the door to hall
pausing he slowly goes back into room
from the archway he spies a french window that ajar
the intruder rushes to it and steps onto a balcony
a pair of flip flops lies on the below
he rushes inside and leaves the bedroom as our view shifts to someone who lies under the bed behind a box

someone gazes listlessly around the busy room and makes her way to workstation
her chest heaves as she looks over the cluster of monitors keyboard and audio controls her
she slowly sits and rests a hand next to keyboard
someone turns to coworker
she nods to her friend and they both face terminals
facing the screens she relaxes her shoulders she stares at the main display and the green ready icon in the center of interface

she looks down it
the icon green
she shuts eyes

on the lower level children ride a miniature train around a display of lollipops
amid the shoppers two teenage girls ride up escalator
autumn pulls out a phone
smiling autumns blond friend shakes head
meanwhile someone dumps a prescription pill into her hand by a running faucet
she sips water from a clear plastic cup and thrusts back her head as swallows
with her eyes closed she leans on sink

someone gazes herself
later she places the pill bottle beside several others at locker
she eyes a newspaper clipping for leah templetons memorial taped inside door

from behind a pillar we watch her put her purse on her shoulder and collect a few bags
the blond sips her drink then finds autumns prepaid track phone on table
she grabs the phone and stands looking autumn
smiling the blond shakes her head and slides the phone into her pocket
now she strolls through a quiet garage
she keeps her eyes on the phone a sedan almost backs her
her body falls limp and he drags her to sedan
in the hive someone leads her trainees to a young workstation
someone glances at trainer
someone stares someone
now a bit of light sneaks through a round car speaker and lands on the face
her closed eyelids quiver as her head slightly about
opening her eyes the dazed teen faces the interior of a trunk
her eyes about
slowly blinking the blond rolls her head to side
a soft red light glows on her cheek from one of the lights
the young blond quickly around
realizing her location she presses her hands to roof
then frantically bangs on the speaker

the killer faces the sedan with his mouth open
the terrified teen keeps her eyes on roof
frozen in place his frenzied gaze softens on trunk
holding her headset someone shifts her wide frantic eyes to the gps screen

holding the phone against chin
she chews her fingertip and looks at a map of the santa hills
she glances over shoulder
she looks down at her watch someone taps her thumbnail against the face
glancing back up to her monitor she finds someones profile with a photo
her eyes dart and she rises from chair
a single cars headlights cut through darkness
drives
a police cruiser passes in the direction
another follows coming down the road
later she parks her car on a road
someone shuts off her car and seated
the car faces someones cottage
three porch lights illuminate exterior
now someone slowly pushes the front door open and shines a inside
she hits a light switch which turns on a single lamp that barely sheds light on room
our view spies on her through an inner door opened crack
someones flashlight beam finds a couch and settles briefly on a big tricycle
on the fireplace mantle she finds family photographs including ones of someone and kids
from behind the door we watch as she moves the flashlight across mantle
our view lingers on the operator then ducks back as she turns us
someone spots an open doorway and moves into the room
in the corner plastic sheets cover furniture
she finds a step ladder with three paint cans at base
moving through the space she enters another room filled with belongings
someone aims her flashlight at the boxes and singles out
she pulls the flaps open and finds it packed with equipment
someone picks up a green rubber glove then drops disgustedly
looking away she finds another box filled with trophies photos
someone removes a framed picture of someones beautiful sister
in it the lively teen poses on her belly chin in her hands and ankles crossed up her
someone digs deeper into box
the operator pulls out a album
flipping through it she finds photos of the young siblings
she studies another portrait of the grinning blond then finds an envelope with pictures
in the first photo the teen girl sits in the wheelchair gurney wearing a gown
only the slightest remnants of hair remain on head
someone compares the picture to someones portrait
which shows off her thick hair
someone shuffles through more photos showing the sickly girl with her brother at bedside
at the end of the stack she finds a photo of the boy kissing sister
her lips parted someone away
now someone exits the cottage and stares out into the darkness with the flashlight at side
she turns her head then steps off the low wooden front porch and heads for car
she stops and furrows brow
she turns listening
now someone shines her flashlight as she traverses a path through a field
she walks astride a row of bushes and approaches a pole
the snap hooks at the end of the cable sway against pole
the flag flapping in breeze
lowering the flashlight she looks at the snap hooks then surveys the area
someone turns away from the underbrush and goes deeper into field
she carefully sidesteps as she lowers the flashlight and discovers a small black object in dirt
bending over she picks up a piece of someones phone
someone glances thoughtfully
she rubs the broken face of the phone and drops it back on ground
catching sight of something she digs around in the dirt and grass
brushing away she peels back a flap of material to reveal an handle
she shines her light over it and examines the grip
with her free hand she grabs the handle and yanks it
lifting a hatch
someone shines her flashlight into the hole and sees a metal ladder leading down feet
looking up she scans field
she switches the light to her other hand and reaches into her pocket
taking out her phone she fumbles with it over the hole and it
the phone lands face up at the foot of ladder
the screen displays a message
someone stares down it
then slowly lifts her head and looks toward the dimly cabin
she turns her gaze back to opening
she leans forward and sets her hand on the hatch
putting a foot on the ladder someone descends into the chamber
as she lowers herself she hesitantly lets go of hatch
the operator carefully climbs down the ladder to the floor and looks at phone
an icon flashes with the words signal
she looks deeper into the chamber as she picks up her phone and swings her flashlight around to survey a hallway
someone hesitantly steps down the hall and inspects the structure
rounding a corner she faces a wall with an exposed frame
turning left she spies a white door with deadbolt
she moves to her right and sees a white plastic lawn chair with a work light hung it
shutting her off
haphazardly nailed slats of wood crisscross the openings between beams
she passes into a lowceilinged room bisected by the crumbling wooden skeleton of wall
as she steps forward the woman cautiously puts out a hand and lightly leans on a dingy partition
she looks at a light shining through a half door
she retreats as someone appears in the door crack and heads in direction
he holds a torn shirt and cloth and tosses down
now someone scurries back through the white door and shuts it pressing herself it
someone stares off then picks up a large bucket and goes back to the room
someone hunches against the door in the darkness then around
she turns on her flashlight and peers at the wall to right
a small green chair sits next to an open wardrobe and a small crystal chandelier hangs over room
someone steps farther into the space and fixes gaze
her eyes widening the 911 operator frozen
she hides as enters
he flips on a light and paces tensely around space
the sweaty killers gaze darts about
he stares downward by the door and himself
someone glances up and across room
as he walks away from the door our view shifts to reveal a pink twin bed covered blood
someone looks at the grim sight and smiles
he goes to a vanity
on it a wig form wears straight hair
on the other side of room
someone hides behind the open door of wardrobe
she watches someone tensely through the thin crack between hinges
leaning forward she sees him with his ring finger in mouth
he slides his finger from his lips leaving his wedding ring between teeth
someone takes it out of his mouth and places it on the finger of a white mannequin hand sitting on vanity
he stares at the form
behind it sits a childhood photo of someone and sister
his mouth quivering the killer gazes at the mannequins face
someone spies him through the crack as he picks up the head
someone holds it close to his face with one hand and sits on the bed with his back someone
he caresses the hair tenderly then pulls it off of head
a dried red drip of blood remains on the forehead
someone examines the interior of wig
someones mouth falls open as she sees the gory scalp underneath the long blond hair in hands
she watches him press his face into the hair and deeply
someone falls back on the bed with the scalp on top of face
someones eye stares fixedly from the narrow space behind door
someone lifts the hair and it
turning it over he pulls out a thin extension
someone balks he tosses aside
he throws the hair into a mini fridge with several other scalps
someone shifts her gaze and discovers someone absent from view
she turns slightly and the agitated appears
he stares intently in direction
someone takes a few measured steps towards the wardrobe his shirt soaked sweat
coming within inches of the woman
he turns to face the hanging clothes and sets his hand on top of the door
someone shuts her mouth in a tight someone while someone closes his eyes and smells the contents of wardrobe
his fingers hang over the thin door above someone she eyes them while someone buries his face in his shirt sleeve someone abruptly turns away and looks at the wig form on bed
the lights in the room go out someone puts her hand over mouth
someone hangs up and faces the officers leaning over body
someones upside down face peers down it
his image blurs refocuses
standing behind the wheelchair someone leans over someone who wears a shower cap on her head and the gas mask over her mouth nose
he adjusts the chair into its position
a tube from someones mask leads to the nitric tank
someone grabs a large black bucket and sets it down next someone
he carefully stuffs loose locks of her flaxen hair into the clear plastic cap
he places his hands on either side of head
the teen shuts eyes
someone goes across the room and retrieves a pair of gloves
he removes the sheath from scalpel
the killer pulls back someones shower cap revealing a dotted marker line on forehead
he cuts into forehead
someone collapses as someone whacks his head with the wig form he turns to her and she bashes him again she stands over him and breaks the ceramic head his
someone runs to someone and looks over the shirtless and captive
she removes her mask and shower cap and holds face
someone turns to see someone behind her he charges and tackles her to the ground with his gloved hands he picks her up by the collar and slams her into the wall he drags the struggling woman across the room she pulls away with all her might and someone takes her head and shoves it into the utility sink full water
he holds her down as her body tenses and bucks someone fights for her life and briefly comes up for air before someone submerges her again
she underwater
someone looks at her wrists then at someone his back turned to the girl
someones face slackens and her body begins relax
someone stoops over her as her weakens
someone stands pointing a pair of surgical scissors at kidnapper
someone takes a step back as someone rises to them
she sees a deep gash running from between his eyebrows down his cheek
pulling herself out of the hole she staggers away from it with someone behind
he stands up his eyes locking on the escaping woman him
he arches his back winces
someone slows her pace and around
someone looks behind him someone
our view shifts down behind someone to the surgical scissors protruding from his back
someone watches nervously as he grips the scissor handle and slowly yanks the instrument out of body
he raises the bloody blades to level
he looks someone
someone delivers a high kick to his back and he falls halfway through the hatch the killer desperately fights to find perches on the ground as he dangles over hole
she and someone peer down at the man
someone looks over the hole at someone who shivering
she stares wideeyes at rescuer
the operator searches her pockets and pulls her phone out of jeans
she activates the screen and 911
she looks up at the young girl who shifts her eyes down to the hatch
someone follows gaze
someone looks up again her bruised left eye almost shut
a deep laceration marring forehead
the two survivors exchange a look
his sweaty head sags against chest
he sits up and blinks times
he catches sight of duct tape binding his wrists to wheelchair
a thick chain circles torso
someone fights to free himself from the chair in his own makeshift room
he turns as someone and someone come view
he squints slightly and scrutinizes face
she stares him down nods
someone turns someone
she leans in close to the face
he looks at pleadingly
now reality
the rugged man descends courthouse stairs and encounters journalists
they outside
he walks off in rain
later he enters a shop
he takes seat
dawning glasses he peruses a file as the news broadcasts him
he whirls around to watch statement
the barista sets the items on the counter later someone stands outside in the shelter of the coffee entryway
he opens the marlboros puts one between his lips and throws the rest of the away
someone lights the cigarette then takes a deep drag
the journalist runs across the street to a building a sign near its entrance millennium
inside he arrives at a suite door bearing the title
as he enters a staff of employees halt and him
he shrugs his brow grimly and goes upstairs to an office inside a lovely blonde in her 40s steps away from her desk and regards sympathetically
a staffer arrives but the woman sends him away with gesture
as someone steps further in she shuts door
someone meets her gaze and his expression wearily
his colleague steps close and intimately nuzzles her forehead his
now a bespectacled old man waits in a conference room with a businessman
outside a woman wearing a helmet arrives on motorcycle
sporting a mohawk she rides elevator
spikes with spiraled ends impale her earlobes using keycards she passes purposefully through a series doors
she hesitates seeing the two men in the glass walled room she sports eyebrow nose and lip rings amid her delicate features her boss waves in
both men stand dressed in black with a matching leather jacket she enters avoiding their gaze and takes a seat at the far end of the table
she sits hunched turned away
she someone
she turns away giving him a full view of her black mohawk
someone faces someone who wearily meets gaze
she stares through darkly eyes
now in a working class highrise she dumps packaged noodles into bowl
a cigarette dangles from her lips as she runs the bowl under tap
she thrusts it into a oven
then takes a can of coke from fridge
heading into the room
someone sits facing laptop
she goes to a vanger industries page profiling someone then hacks into someones account
as someone goes back to the kitchen a new email up
we glimpse content
dear mr someone are you available for an interview regarding the verdict
returning with her steaming noodles someone runs a google search wennerstrom
it leads her to a wikipedia page someone googles wennerstrom industries
a webpage mentions his previous work in the division
now at a christmas gathering someone faces his lover her husband and brunette
someone notices a teen with dark hair watching him he her
someone takes an uneasy breath and sips wine
now in a coat and knit hat someone lights a cigarette as she walks down sidewalk
she pauses within earshot of a entrance
listening as a richly dressed older woman punches in an code
as the woman goes in someone briefly
the ends of her black hair stick out from under hat
framing her jaw chin
someone goes to the keypad enters the code and inside
she pauses looking around then climbs a marble staircase to a directory
as the steps away we find wennerstrom listed on the level
now someone enters a basement area with stonewalls
she comes to the buildings electrical center and photographs the circuit boxes meters wiring
she takes a photo of an hub
she steps back out onto sidewalk
she turns abruptly as a car up
looking over her shoulder she spies wennerstrom out
as he takes out a cellphone someone continues down sidewalk
at the gathering someone finds someone and her mother at table
someone checks her cell phone then puts down
throughout the party other guests do same
someone checks his own phone then it
now sleeping beneath a white comforter someones coeditor awakes alone bed
she lifts her head then up
revealing an oversized shirt with a hem just below hips
she finds someone at a laptop in the room
sitting in his briefs someone turns to her
she away
someone slams his shut
now in a blizzard a train travels a mountainous snow landscape
in a passenger car set with small tables someone sits opposite two strangers his pensive
he rolls his head against seatback
watching trees pass window
the train stops at a platform marked disembarks
shivering he walks to the edge of platform
waiting beside a nearby car waves
now on a narrow snow smeared road the car approaches a bridge with rainbowshaped arches barely wide enough for cars

flashes of white light shoot down beside a mountain
at the head of an army of bare chested humanoids one frost giant opens a box which emits and icy light
swirling winds sweep across the village splintering homes and extinguishing fires a woman clutches a child to herself as they solid
a fiery whirlwind knifes down out of sky
smoke clears to reveal a vast army of armored warriors wearing capes and spears
separated by a few dozen yards the leader of the warriors a grey bearded man wearing a helmet with horns
faces the red eyed blue skinned leader of the giants
the two armies charge into one another swords and spears clashing in the chaos
the warrior leader skewers a giant nearly twice his own height and flings him away the giants leader opens his box freezing two solid
and then smashes them pieces
a spiky ball of ice crystals forms in his hand and he hurls it into a warrior  face
meanwhile a flame shoots from the warrior leader  spears
snow blows around a city of towering structures
the grey bearded warrior thrusts his spear against the frost giant king  throat
a warrior picks up the box
a column of light speeds across outer space to a flat spiral of clouds
a colossal mountain peak topped by glowing crystals jets out of the center of clouds
the mountain tips upside down becoming the base of a landmass supporting tall rugged cliffs separated by clear water
seemingly built into rock
large structures with sweeping terraces top many of cliffs
gleaming pyramids statues and columns surround an enormous peak resembling crystals
within asgard the grey bearded king leads a blonde boy and a blackhaired boy to the box

for below the throne room in the heart of the palace two guards wearing yellow capes march up a corridor with smooth walls
various artifacts sit in recesses along hall
the guards approach the glowing blue box which rests upon a pedestal of scored rock at the end of corridor
hidden in shadows a blue hand slides across a thick column leaving a thin layer frost
smiling someone stares up at someone
meanwhile in the corridor one of the guards stoops to peer at a film of frost spreading across floor
a frost giant grabs the guard by the throat and slashes him with an icy blade sprouting from arm
three frost giants run up the corridor to the translucent box which contains a swirling orb of glowing mist

someone steps onto a dayus behind them and slides his sword into a slot on floor
bolts of white lightning arc from the sword and a crackle around chamber
below them a large spins
outside the domes exterior rotates more and quickly
an elongated pyramid atop the dome tilts toward the horizon and opens like a flower a beam of intense white light fires out it
someone thrusts down sword
someone and his companions shoot down a tunnel and vanish in a flash of light the beam of light shoots straight from the dome into the starry reaches of space
inside the beam someone holds hammer
someone out in front of himself as he hurdles headlong through vibrating streams of light
someone and his companions rocket towards the icy surface jotunheim
as thick smoke clears someone gazes around himself at the terrain
he and his companions stand at the edge of cliff
dark fingers of jagged rock jet upward stalagmites
a light falls
someone sighs as he follows someone and others
carrying a thick ax on shoulder
someone brings up rear
ahead of them a huge shard of black rock falls and splinters against ground
eyes darting as he surveys his surroundings someone leads the group through distant structures resembling ruins of stone pillars arches
staying close together the warriors make their way over uneven shelves of ice
someone pulls his fur coat tighter around himself as fierce winds blow the falling snow horizontal

someones allies watch as the beast shakes its head free revealing a wide mouth filled fangs
spinning like a whirlwind someone continues to battle frost giants as his flee
meanwhile the heavily muscled creature breaks free of its shell
carried by someone someone looks back as the beast races toward them on legs
smashing through boulders of rock and ice in its path twirling his hammer so fast that it blurs someone flings chunks of the ground like projectiles a huge column of black rocks topples behind the others as they flee the beast which burst through the barricade as if it were made matchsticks
the creature swings its spiked tail toward someone misses
still twirling his hammer someone watches as frost giants close in him
he thrusts someone skyward imbuing it with a bolt of lightning then slams the hammer into the ground a huge shockwave ripples outward and sweeps away the giants in a swell of earth
the shockwave spreads toppling rock formations and collapsing the ground beneath the frost giant  feet
the beast swipes at someone but falls backward into a phisher
someones fleeing companions race just ahead of the collapsing ice which exposes an immense cavern
upside down now the creature clings to the underside of the ice as it races directly beneath someone and the others as they leap over widening cracks in the terrain
the warriors stop at the edge of a cliff as one of the beasts clawed hands reaches up in front them
the creature pulls itself up narrows its beady red eyes roars
spinning his hammer someone leaps high into air

on earth the destroyer turns and away
someone shuts her eyes sobs
frowning someone and someone nearby
someone strokes someone  s face as the destroyer recedes into distance
lying in his bed under the canopy
someone sheds a tear
back at the crater compound a needle spikes on an electronic instrument as a technician holds it out someone

the war hammer boomerangs back and strikes the destroyer to ground
wearing his old battle armor and red cape someone someone
lifting its head the destroyer fires again but someone flies into storm clouds swirling in sky
someone and the others retreat as strong winds whip up someone
the destroyer rises to its feet and upward
high above twirling his hammer over his head someone hovers in the eye of the storm as lightning flashes him
the winds intensify pelting the destroyer with chunks of concrete and cars
the whirlwind sucks the destroyer into sky
it fires energy beams at someone who beats them away someone
holding the war hammer out in front of himself someone dives and shoves someone into the destroyers open visor a huge blast flashes over the town and outward
the destroyer plummets from the sky and smashes onto the below

stepping out of a car agent someone someone
someone pulls someone to side
someone and someone shoot into sky
back in asgard someone pulls his spears out of the mechanism
standing with a host of frost giants someone grins they follow someone toward the city passing someone still encased in ice with his face frozen in scream

back on earth the research vehicle drives toward the location of the arrival
someone steps into the circular pattern on ground
someone stares at the sky then furrows brow
he glances at someone who stands at the edge
someones icy cocoon fractures a more
someone bursts free in a shower of ice crystals then quickly kills two frost giants him
in the observatory someone slides his sword into the bifrost mechanism

someone freezes the mechanism
frost spreads over the equipment as well as through the branching bolts of electricity forming a flickering tree of ice in the center of chamber
someone lands at observatory
someone raises someone but someone knocks him to the floor with a blast from spear
on jotunheim frost giants flee as towering pinnacles of ice and stone crumble them
back on earth someone someone and someone gaze up at a flashing storm cloud as they stand around a circular pattern on ground

that night someone and someone look down at a cabin lodged into a hillside

someone readies his rifle pistol
someone eyes nervously

someone picks up his rifle and looks down into gloom
a lone rider approaches cabin
someone and someone watch the rider head along a track towards the cabin stop
smoke billows from the cabin  chimney
the rider dismounts and walks his horse toward cabin
as someone enters the cabin several more approach
someone cocks his rifle and takes aim someone looks nervously between the cabin and the posse
someone and someone keep watching from hill
someone walks out of the cabin and steps up to the four riders who sit side by side on their horses him

snowflakes gently drift through darkness
the dead men are propped up outside cabin
inside someone sits with a bandage over shoulder
someone lies on bunk
someone in
someone drinks whiskey from bottle
they slowly ride across the plains
he throws his bottle in air
he misses and the bottle lands on grass
on the fourth shot the breaks
someone stares at someone who dismounts and tumbles to ground
he keeps hold of his horses reigns and drunkenly struggles to feet
someone twirls his gun in his hand and goes to his bag
he digs around and some bits of yellow cornbread out
he takes a piece and stands with his apart
he throws the cornbread in air
and shoots it bits

and before he can shoot someone takes shot
someone misses and stares at his frowning
someone goes to his bag
someone hurls yet piece
both he and shoot
and the explodes
someone holsters his gun and someone hurls piece
he wildly
under a pale sky someone someone and someone ride across a vast prairie of short grass
behind them in the distance is a range
fluffy white clouds hang in a blue sky above the trio as their horses plod on across a largely landscape
they ride through longer grass beside a river another empty whiskey bottle hits water
the three riders meander through tangled pale trees
they cross river
under a canopy of swollen dark gray clouds they head across a plain of grass
as they head through a pine forest someone sticks another empty bottle over the end of a thin branch
someone stands framed by the square entrance to a mine
he shoots into darkness
someone in
the entrance is surrounded by craggy cliffs
a night
by a campfire someone mashes some cornbread and water and holds it out someone
someone wood
stands
someone sits staring him
someone shocked
someone stares intensely at someone who sits beneath a hide canopy strung up between trees
she goes to someone
he earnest
he mounts horse
he looks down at her from horse
he holds out his hand
someones brow pinched
and tears glisten in eyes
she takes someones hand and they hold each others gaze for moment
he leans down her
he touches his hat turns his horse and rides off through trees
someone watches go
she goes back to camp
the fire glows gold on her face
she looks down at someone sleeping on hides
she picks up a reel of rope lying him
and lays it on the ground surrounding bedding
later someone sleeps soundly wrapped in blanket
someone slumbers a heap
someone watches him for moment
she pulls back her blanket and gets up she picks up a wooden bucket by its handle
someone carries the wooden bucket through the wintry brush her oversized coat belted up tightly around waist
she passes between slender leafless trees crossing the snow dappled ground to the edge of a shallow fast river
she takes a few uninhibited steps into the water and dips bucket
she looks up to see three or four horses drinking from the water on the side
a figure steps out from behind a thicket with his back her
someone stares at him as he tends to horses
the man turns to look her
he has a black someone on his cheek
its someone they eyes
they eyes
someone drops the bucket and it floats away on water
someone takes a rifle from over his shoulder and advances a few steps with the gun leveled her
someone fumbles in her pocket
someone shakes head
having slung the rifle back over his shoulder someone watches someone wrest her pistol from the sack
someone narrows his eyes incredulously he looks away then raises eyebrows
she shoots him as he starts towards her and the recoil puts her on her backside in water
someone doubles pain
someone picks herself again
an indignant someone stalks toward her she pulls the trigger but the gun doesnt fire someone snatches it and her
someone marches her across river
two men open fire on someone from the other side of the river and he takes cover behind tree
someone trade shots with the men who then disappear into woods
with someone someone
an ugly rat faced man has someone by wrist
the man lucky ned throws her to the ground he draws a revolver and stamps a boot against cheek
he sneers and lifts gaze
he keeps his gun pointed someone
out of sight in the trees he drags her to her feet and continue
a simpleton springs out the man waggles his elbows like chicken
reconvened they climb a track
they approach camp
someone and someone sit by fire
smirks
a distant someone fires his pistol at sky
someone responds in kind then watches through a telescope as someone heads off on his horse with little blackie behind
someone turns someone
and twirling the slender telescope between fingers
he sits down opposite her by campfire
the men ride off on horseback leaving someone alone someone
clutching his rifle like a walking stick and holding a gloved hand to his chest
someone sits down on a box by the campfire
he hangs his head and stares at the ground someone looks somewhat disgusted by selfpity
someones eyes closed
someone wears a expression
someone stares at expectantly
he looks her
someone swallows smoke rises from the fire between them as rises
he pounces pinning her to the ground and putting a knife to throat
clobbered with a rifle butt someone hits the ground someone looks up to see someone unconscious
they look down at plain
on the dusty scrub land below someone rides back towards someone and his three members
one of whom is the simpleton
they bring their horses to a halt as someone draws near gaunt whiskered someone peers out at someone from beneath a hat
someone flashes a grin
someone draws a rifle and someone two pistols gripping the reigns between teeth
as he gallops toward his foes
charging someones men fan out someone shoots the simpleton someone aims rifle
someone shoots and one of someones men slumps down the side of saddle
another puts a bullet through shoulder
someone blasts him through chest
the man tumbles from his horse cracking his head against a rock in a shower blood
someone and someone each fire as they paths
someone buckles and someones horse down
someone stands sharply gasps
a dust cloud rises from the ground where someones horse fallen
his leg is trapped it
and he struggles in vain to himself
someone approaches sitting slumped on horse
someone squints down the barrel of his rifle as he aim
pants
someone limply points and cocks pistol
someone takes breath
someone is but a tiny speck far below on plain
still astride his horse someone doesnt move muscle
someone looks up from his gun frowns
someone over
someone bashes someone on the head with a boulder knocking unconscious
someone quickly grabs his rifle but someone gets hold of barrel
someone rests it free of grasp
and traps him in sights
she makes sure the gun cocked
scowling he does as told
she blasts him off the cliff edge thrown off balance by the recoil someone trips over a log and tumbles backwards through a crevice into a cave
bouncing down a steep rocky slope she lands on her back and snags her foot on a tree root light pours in through the dust shrouded mouth of cave
someone grimaces in pain and sits slightly
she tries to free her foot cannot
breathless she stares up through the narrow mouth
she collapses despairingly
then sits again
she glances about the cave and frowns as her eyes alight on a dead body lying just a few away
she slowly looks the dead over
and spots a knife ina belt around waist
someone reaches out and grasps one of the man  boots
dragging him closer with ease
as she does so his leg comes apart at knee
she instead pulls his thigh and then shirt
which rips as she so
someone stares horror
in the hollow where the corpse  s viscera should be is a coiled and rattlesnake
it starts move
someone pulls away but the corpse slides closer panics
she turns to look at the corpse her head now level with its skull
the snake closer
she sits up and fumbles with the root
someone throws a rope into the cave and starts down slope
a snake glides onto someones shoulder and she flings it aside as someone descends clutching rope
another snake sinks its teeth into her hand
someone shoots his pistol at ground
he reaches someone who grimaces pain
she nods at her hand which grasps
there are two puncture marks in flesh
someone closes her eyes and someone scores an x between the fang marks with his large knife
he sucks poison from the wound and spits out
he cuts her foot free of the tree root and returns the knife to his pocket
wrapping the rope around them both he then takes someone in arms
someone walks little blackie away from the cave pulling someone and someone up on rope
someone gallops off with someone trees
they continues along the plain passing the slain bodies of gang
someone looks down at the simpleton lying sprawled on the earth
someones horse lies dead beside someone who  s own horse stands him
silhouetted against the pale sky someone gallops on across the plain
someone glances at the setting sun her face cast in its glow
sets in and soon gives way night
but little blackie going
someone and someone ride on through trees and grass
the sky black
the horse begins tire
someone stabs blackie
little blackie forages onward kicking up dust in wake
little blackies breath clouds in front of him his neck glistening with sweat in moonlight
someone sways back and forth along with the horses gait
she sees a silhouetted horseman ahead
little blackie hobbles to standstill
little blackie sinks to his knees and topples over spilling someone and someone from the saddle little blackies head hits the ground with thud
someone drags someone away him
someone looks at the exhausted horse and put his hand on pistol
someone bends down to scoop someone up in arms
she resists pushing him away bitterly and beating at his chest with fists
someone picks her up and her subsides
someone gazes back tearfully at blackie
as someone carries her away across plain
someone lulls her head back and someone picks up his pace trotting briskly on as fast as legs
someone him
someone stares ahead with a look of determination his grizzled countenance picked out by the moonlight
someone has a pained and weary face her hair damp with sweat and her brow furrowed
someone staggers to a halt and drops to knees
he takes out his pistol and points it in air
cradling someone in his arms someone hangs head
a light comes on in a house a short away
a figure dressed in white longjohns steps out onto the front porch with lantern
someone looks down someone
the image of the figure on the porch fades black
someone stares out of a window
now a grown woman with slim features and a severe expression she wears her dark hair up beneath a hat
the train stops and she steps down onto a platform
her left arm now ends at elbow
it reads for a show
she approaches two seated men on the site
stands
nods
she glares at seated someone
she away
someones coffin is loaded onto a train ashen faced someone stands at grave
his headstone reads cogburn
snow drifts down on the plot where a small number of gravestones clustered
someone cuts a lonely figure as she away
they arrive school
as someones son slings his backpack over his shoulder a breaks
his books out
he takes his hand
his son grabs his lunch and off
a blonde woman holds out a dish
someone it
still holding onto the dish she draws closer
she gives a look
smiling politely he away
as he returns to his car a group of chatting mothers gazes after him later he strolls a neighborhood with a rugged man
they glance at diner
someone spots a restaurant ahead and his falls
he away
he drapes an arm someone
someone blinks his eyes
the two men bow to other
hug
they ways
someone bows him
his brother spreads arms
now in office
the silverhaired editor lifts brow
someone away
he slings his bag onto shoulder
later in a office
his son sits him
he strides to an open awning window which jiggles in the wind steadying it he takes out a tool on keychain
entering the office the principal furrows his brow as he sees someone fiddling with window
he beckons someone into the hall and leads him past artwork posted above lockers
a drawing shows a man with his head flying off his neck
he holds someones gaze with concerned looks both men shift their eyes back to someones drawing where the bald decapitated mans tongue juts from his mouth in agony as his head flies away from body
blood spurts from his sliced neck and drips from slashes along jawline
the principal shoots the father a horrified glance then off
turning thoughtfully to his son someone sees him leaning against the bank of lockers with his arms crossed the teen stares back at broodingly
as his father approaches someone hoists his backpack onto shoulder
someone strides out of the school with his son right him
at home someone opens the fridge to reveal stacks of plastic containers with notes them
his daughter watches as he fits the new casserole inside
sitting at a table in a breakfast nook he smiles he watches his daughter spread peanut butter and jelly on slices of bread in the kitchen
she combines the slices to make two sandwiches then grabs bags
she bags sandwiches
holding a marker someone draws a check someone in air
she smiles as she resumes work
someone watches her with an amused stare
on the storage bags white label someone writes pb and a j
now someone pushes open someones bedroom door and finds his son asleep on top of covers
the teens hand rests on a leatherbound book resembling journal
entering the room someone gently lifts his sons hand and takes book
he sits on the edge of the bed and shoots someone a glance
furrowing his brow he opens the book to a pair of skillfully sketches
one shows a bald burly man with a look
and the other depicts a face
with a expression
darksmudged pencil work creates gloomy shading around figures
nodding someone turns the page in the next sketch a boy sits with his elbows on a table his face buried in hands
at the center of the table tiny people stand around a chasm
the sketch on the opposite page shows a woman cradling a baby while a figure watches from doorway
flipping to the next pages
someone finds a drawing filling up sides
in it an anguished threeeyed face lets out a scream its red uvula visible through its gaping mouth someone sets the sketchbook aside and caresses his sons shaggy bangs
later in a bathroom he dabs his mouth with a towel and wipes his hands then lifts his eyes to a mirror above sink
he stares at his weary reflection
he shifts his gaze to a cluster of pill bottles filling shelf
the shelf below contains jewelry knickknacks and a framed photo of him someone
someone lowers his eyes
someone stands in doorway
picking her up someone carries her into bedroom
reaching a bed piled high with stuffed animals he sits on its edge and sets someone on lap
he gazes out a window at a party in the yard door
she watches them with a look
turning from the window someone holds tighter
she rests her head against his shoulder and closes her eyes as he returns his attention to the young partygoers next door a blonde woman holding a beer spots him and gives a wave
he wistfully
daytime in a car someone flips through a binder of property listings as he rides besides a dimplechinned man glasses
in the back seat someone plays with a camera
nods
someone eyes the real estate agent thoughtfully then shrugs his lips in an look
now someone lifts the camera as they cruise past a house
someone flips to another listing in the binder they drive past a plaingray twostory home with trim
they pass a cozylooking white house with an chimney
flipping through the binder someone furrows his brow they pull up in front of a ranchstyle house with a yard covered in plants
someone holds out listing
they drive up a rustic road
gazing out her window someone smiles up ahead the house lies shrouded behind a cluster of mature trees a slack jawed someone eyes the property
the car parks alongside an old wooden fence we glimpse the sun through a canopy of branches
then find someone riding on her fathers shoulders aiming her camera at the quaint twostory house
someone inside
he looks around the spacious mostly rooms
he follows upstairs
from a window she overlooks countryside
startled by the sound someone and someone around
outside a male lion walks up to a fence
someone someone and the real estate agent watch him from the side
someone looks up at dad
he looks at his daughter who lowers her gaze
they leave enclosure
he looks back but finds no sign of daughter
the real estate agent follows him up a set of stairs set into hillside
they find someone feeding crackers peacocks
the agent pats him on the shoulder then off
someone takes a seat on a rock and watches his daughter sprinkle her crackers on ground
as he glances aside and smiles a ray of sunlight haloes his hair shoulders
someone meets her fathers gaze smiles
welling with emotion beams
he chuckles to himself then licks his lips
glancing back at the lion enclosure he locks eyes with the big cat sunlight glares behind someones joyful face the lions soulful eyes watch him through the chain links now at restaurant
a waitress brings food
he storms off leaving his father and sister at the table
they tap forks now pack
he holds up sweatshirt
someone shifts her jaw and gives nod
someone puts it in a box
he holds out a puppet
now the familys suv drives through the neighborhood followed by a mayflower truck
someone eyes his rear view mirror then glances back at someone who earbuds
the concerned father returns his attention to the road ahead and notices doms
patrons eat at sidewalk tables outside the cafe
as he drives by someone stares at a bank windows
we glimpse someone sitting alone at a booth inside her brown eyes find us and she gives a smile
the suv now leads the moving truck onto the zoo property in the back seat someone sighs and shifts his unhappy gaze indoors a blonde teenage girl attaches lightup letters to a metal frame which she displays in window
someone halts vehicle
the sign reads welcome brave owners
someone waves to the blonde girl who smiles and back
from the back seat someone waves well
someone stares curiously at the welcoming stranger inside the restaurant she moves along the dingy windows continuing to wave as she watches them on
someone keeps his eyes on her until a tree finally blocks view
now in a downpour a burly bearded man in a raincoat pushes a wheelbarrow full mulch
a sultry woman stands in an barn
she watches the mees in
she trades a look with her bearded colleague someone leads the kids to door
he opens it and their beagle darts in past the counters
the boy off
now on a dry day the mees meet the zoo outside
the monkey waves someone
he glances at someone someone shifts her gaze
he rubs someones shoulder causing him to turn away embarrassment
sitting on someones shoulder crystal slaps a hand over head
he marches off but the staff heads in the direction
an entry gate sign reads rosemoor park
someone walks someone
someone walks someone
we glimpse a binturong crossing a branch a fox lying in tall grass one parrot grooming another a camel licking its mouth and a bear
someone gives someone an look
the frizzyhaired man off
someone shyly averts gaze
he off
someone hurries after him someone leads the group down a trail lined with tall bushes as they reach the low wall of a tiger enclosure someone halts upon seeing the big cats and holds them in his gaze
one of the tigers steps past two others lounging in grass
someone admiringly
she leans on wall
a tiger up
someone smiles bit
someone rolls eyes
someone studies the old tiger later someone and someone walk ahead of kids
he notes
someone slows her pace and stuffs her hands in pockets
someone pensively
he lowers his thoughtful gaze and purses lips
someone waits for reply
he lifts his eyes and earnestly meets gaze
the zookeepers jaw slack
someone smiles then continues up the trail he looks back with grin
someone stares after him with a pinched brow then allows a faint smile as she jogs forward to catch up with him on hill
at night someone invoices
wearing reading glasses he sits alone at the end of the dining room table in front of a laptop and surrounded by bills he touches his brow as he continues to review expenses
his attention drifts to window
he goes out onto porch
ambles to the railing with his hands stuffed in his pockets listens
he watches the wispy branches of a tree sway in the breeze
he looks to left
he looks to the right then back at tree
soft moonlight shines on his face
he steps down from porch
meanwhile someone lies in bed staring at a framed photo of himself with mother
he presses the picture to his chest and wraps his arms around it with tears in eyes
now someone enters the restaurant
he finds the staff in a dining room adorned with a framed photo of someone warhol as well as memorabilia of maccreadys past
including a photo of him giving a lion a ride in a vintage car
noticing someone someone opens arms
he throws darts at a mans photo attached to dartboard
he pulls out a chair someone

the bartender brings him a tall glass beer
someone takes a long drink keeping his back to the patron
he lowers his glass and bitterly
best
with a cold scowl he turns to face stranger
his friend glances up from drink
since i was a boy my father made the finest suits dusseldorf
someone extends a cordial arm my parents were dusseldorf
he them
he clinks his glass with the man
he toasts the man
as he raises his glass to his lips the other two follow suit swapping looks
someone takes a long drink and the others wait until he lowers his glass before they warily their
someone turns his arm over revealing his concentration number
the pig farmer reaches for a knife as his friends widen
he plunges the knife at someone who disarms him pins his wrist on the table and reads an inscription on the blade blood honor
he stabs the farmers hand the bartender aims gun
someone glowers at his shooter
the bartenders arm trembles and he stares at the gun his aim sweeps toward the tailor and the moves
someone sends the knife flying into the bartender  s chest summons it back into his grip and pins the farmers hand to table
he finishes beer
someone faces gravely
the holocaust turns
he gets to his feet leaving the former nazi helplessly
someone swaggers to the photo hanging on the wall and stares at piercingly
the gun floats to his hand and he aims at farmer
on the wall the farmers collapses

beyond the agent the bar dissolves into images of someone someone frost in her diamond form and appearing
someone lowers hand
someone lowers gaze
now words appear beneath a dock miami florida on yacht
someone faces someone who reclines on a chair
as the cyclonemaking mutant approaches someone produces grenade
someone hooks his finger around the pin
peering at him through dark sunglasses someone coolly strolls up to the commander
he reaches out and pries the explosive from grasp
someone gives smirk
someone shifts anxiously on his feet as someone pulls pin
someone looks calmly
a fiery blast blots him from view then shrinks someones clothes flutter as he contains the explosion between his hands then it
he taps someones shoulder from the point of contact radiant energy expands and consumes his form at headquarters
someone someone
he someone
someone and someone looks
seated by someone someone bolts to her feet and assumes the middleaged jowly form of someone
she smiles at the staring slackjawed agent with face
dark scales flutter around her figure in waves as she shifts into her natural form
someone drily faces someone someone
a portly man in black seated in a corner up
later in hallway
he freezes at a fountain
the arching water grazes nose
now in a structure
nighttime someones anchored yacht looms us
its polished hull caspartina
from the rippling water below someones emerge
he gazes intently at the extravagantly large craft

taking cover he draws the nazis blood and honor knife from a sheath
someone stalks out onto the deck

she turns back to flesh blood
a military approaches
ahead of the ship three motorized inflatable boats carry armed soldiers toward yacht
someone narrows her eyes and our view of fragments
the motorized boats near the yacht kicking up spray in wake
the cyclonemaker steps to the edge of the yacht deck and a whirlwind springs from each of his hands he hurls them at the boats
on the ships deck gawks
the whirlwind knocks the boats high in air
in the water someone lifts his arms the yachts anchor chains rise all around him in a corridor
recovering someone marches back out on the deck points
one of the yachts anchors rises high above deck
someone thrusts a forward
the anchor swoops down crashes through the smokestack and plows through the upper deck it rises high as someone someone and the man in stare
someone whips the anchor chain around the corridors
inside someone and someone flee down a hallway as the chain slices through the walls the upper cabins collapse in wake
someone flings an arm and the anchor loose
our view sinks beneath the water to find a hatch in the yachts underside releasing submarine
treading water someone turns as the underwater vessel pulls away he grits his teeth and stretches his hands it
the submarine shakes but continues through the water as someone and his followers reach an allwhite bridge
water surges around someones head as the vessel drags him in wake
on the ship sailors gather on decks
the submarine drags someone beneath water
completely submerged he bares his gritted teeth and keeps a stubborn hold on submarine
on the ship someone runs along the deck then dives from the edge he plunges into the water behind someone and wraps his arms him
two veins throb in someones forehead as someone drags him toward the surface in the escaping submarine someone shifts his gaze
the two surface

designed to cover the head
steelhued trim frames its specialized opening

as someone faces someone she exhales and lowers chin
she stares piercingly at someone her narrowing
relaxing she tilts her head and cocks eyebrow
someone gratefully
someone holds up a glass liquor
someones fade

as it plops into drink
we drift back and find the sub in the midst of a sea
in a recess at the lab someone sits someone
someone leans close
she lays her forearm across lap

someone flips more switches and a strip of paper begins to move like a conveyor belt under the arms of a recorder
white light glows down someone
he clutches railings at his sides his chest heaves as he envisions shooting into the air past hundreds of humans emerging on a blanket of clouds his gaze sweeps from three girls to a man reading a book to a darkskinned girl with hair
smiles
someone finds a girl being examined by an doctor
in the transmitter someone watches printer

his minds eye zooms from person to person in clouds
then focuses on a blackhaired young woman in booty shoots and a bra with fringe

beyond the outstretched fingers of his hand
the submarine rises from deep
the submarines spinning propellers emerge from water
followed by four fins

through his binoculars the admiral watches the rise
he lowers the lenses his slack
an american radioman lowers headset
the submarine floats past the russian ship where several sailors watch from deck
the captain on
in the cockpit beast pushes a lever firing the jets engines
someone holds his position on the gear
while the jet and the submarine fly side by side en route to a shoreline ahead
on board the independence the admiral and his men peer through windows encasing bridge
a hatch on top of the sub opens and someones darkhaired cohort climbs out wearing a tailored suit
someone peers at the someone who twirls engulfing himself in a cyclone which grows tremendously in size and crosses onto the surface of sea
someone holds his gaze
beast eyes twister
the cyclone swallows jet
on board someone and someone themselves
someone loses control and the submarine drops to the edge of the sandy shore landing on side
someone clings to the gear
tumbling across the beach the submarine mows down several palm trees creating a cloud sand
as it comes to a stop sand blots out view
a wing breaks from the aircraft igniting a blaze
someone eyes the cockpit where beast works controls
someone dangles from jet
someone pulls him into cabin
the jet crash lands on beach
someone hits the floor and someone covers him securing them both to the metal hull as the jet upsidedown

he removes the burning disc then up
flapping her wings angel scans deck
someone flies up from the water and sends angel tumbling off course with a scream
she regains her balance then chases the young mutant across sky
in the submarine someone crosses office
behind him the wall parts revealing the chamber
someone cautiously approaches doorway
meanwhile angel chases someone past battleship
staying on his tail she spits several fireballs strafing sea
someone corkscrews over a ship then glides down near water

the young mutant screams and the sailors fall to knees
someone sprints across the deck leaps and grabs onto hand
the young mutant carries his friend over water
angel chases them
dangling underneath someone someone eyes a below
angel spits a fireball which tears through one of someones wings

the coin drifts toward someones form
in the xjet someone breathes concentrating
someone looks on behind him back in sub

a sideon view that tracks the coins path switches between someone someone
