SOMEONE works his way up to a sprint, staring at SOMEONE through wild eyes.
The real estate agent turns and trots up the beach toward a row of hedges.
SOMEONE pauses, watching him run toward a gate-like gap in the greenery.
As SOMEONE passes out of sight, the wronged husband dashes toward the hedge line.
Glancing over his shoulder, he slows, then quickens his pace to a reckless scramble.
He arrives at the hedge and ducks behind it near the gap.
Seen from inside, the gap shows SOMEONE darting across to take cover behind the opposite hedge.
He peeks up over the top and finds SOMEONE climbing steps
to a one-story home with a broad roof, a full-length porch, and a sprawling lawn.
SOMEONE stares, only the top half of his face visible,
as SOMEONE kicks off his running shoes and goes inside.
Staying put, SOMEONE narrows his eyes.

SOMEONE notices, as the boys race to the water.

The boys splash each other rambunctiously.
SOMEONE leans toward SOMEONE.

Now, shafts of sunlight beam through gaps in the clouds, lighting up patches of the ocean.
In a forest, a rusted metal bridge spans a green brook.
Raindrops plop into the placid water, dotting it with tiny percolations.
Now, SOMEONE, his daughters, and SOMEONE walk toward an inviting ragtag bungalow with a porch and white-fenced yard.
A sign out front reads "Tahiti Nui Restaurant Cocktail Lounge".
SOMEONE leads the way up to the porch, then through the doorway.
The family pauses near the threshold, taking in the thriving casual hot spot.
On a small stage, three male singers perform on stools as they strum a guitar, a ukulele, and a bass.

Taking a breath, he shakes himself out of his thoughts.
SOMEONE, who is seated between his daughters, faces us as though we're in SOMEONE's position.
SOMEONE bobs to the music.
SOMEONE looks at us.
SOMEONE's looking at us as he replies. His gaze wilts. He glances at the band, then rubs his face.
His weary profile shows against the backdrop of the lively performers. He idly surveys the bar, then peers over his shoulder,
giving us a view of his distracted face head on.
Now, under a dusky sky, SOMEONE, his daughters, and SOMEONE walk alongside a fence that borders a green field.
Mountains loom in the distance. SOMEONE and SOMEONE walk a few paces ahead.
SOMEONE bites her lip.
At night, SOMEONE addresses SOMEONE.

SOMEONE nods faintly. Her father turns away and hangs his head.
In the window seat beside her big sister, SOMEONE sleeps with
a pillow between her head and the wall.
As she stirs a little, getting comfortable, the image dissolves to a corridor in the hospital.
SOMEONE, his daughters, and SOMEONE trudge in from around a corner.
As the girls approach SOMEONE's bed, SOMEONE wraps her arm around her sister's shoulders. They gaze at their unresponsive mother.
She lies with each hand curled around a rolled up towel and her mouth hanging slack.
Now, a kind-faced woman addresses SOMEONE.

He lifts his gaze from his dying daughter and glances, unfocused, toward the doorway.
In the morning, sunlight peeks through a blanket of clouds
and shines down on a lush mountain ridge.
At home, SOMEONE sleeps with his face resting on his cluttered desk.
One of his fingers twitches and he awakes.
With a frown, he sits up.
Blinking groggily, he looks at his watch, then leans forward on his elbows and shifts his thoughtful eyes.
He pushes his chair back from the desk and rises.
He exits past the portraits of his great great grandparents.
The image dissolves to a sprawling wind-blown property.
SOMEONE’s car glides toward a fork in a long driveway.
To one side lies a large ranch style house and a tennis court.
On the other, grazing ducks scatter as SOMEONE pulls over onto a well-manicured lawn and parks.
Now, he enters the large house, allowing sunlight to filter through the screen door into the unlit living room.
As he pushes open the curtains on the front windows,
more daylight washes over a wall decorated with framed photos.
He strolls past it,
then stops and gazes at the black and white images of his ancestors. 
A mustached man gives a serious look. Another shows a frizzy-haired woman.
In a third photo, four men in suits stand on a building's front steps.
Behind the glass of a large frame, wooden block letters spell out "Kikila". Above an antique photo of a man with a mutton chop beard, a plaque beside it reads "Cecil Kikila King. the namesake of this beautiful place. He was a prominent attorney, banker, and socialite in old Hawaii.".
SOMEONE eyes more photos of family members throughout the years. two men and two women in 1920s era garb.
Leaving the photos, SOMEONE steps out onto the lawn.
A group of about 40 suddenly fades into view -
some at picnic tables, others standing around chatting.

The scene in front of him fades to SOMEONE's hospital room, where our view edges closer to the back of his head
as he watches his family.
Now, we travel up the bed quilt to SOMEONE's hands
still curled loosely around the towel rolls.
Just above the neckline of her hospital gown,

On the yet unsold land, the overlook offers a majestic view of the cove and the meadows and wild groves inland of it.
Beyond a line of breaking waves, vibrant shades of ocean blue extend to the horizon meeting powder blue sky.
