SOMEONE nervously shifts his gaze. He's pallid mother blinks down at the casket. SOMEONE backs away.
As he shuffles off, his mother grabs his arm.
Glancing at SOMEONE's grave over his shoulder, he pulls away, then breaks into a run. He abandons the funeral and sprints into the forest.
More headstones stand.
SOMEONE races pass them.
With his brother's baseball glove, he jogs down a trail.
As the setting sun flares through the trees around him ramming into the path.
He sees the scene of accident. 
He starts to push himself up, then lowers his head toward the ground.
The grieving brother crawls onto his hands and knees, then weakly sits up. His chest heaves as he grimaces tearfully and hangs his head. The baseball rolls back out of the forest toward the mitt.

SOMEONE's gaping mouth curls into a faint smile. His brother gives a sharp nod. The ruddy leather mitt and white baseball lie on the mossy ground between them. 
Our view rises into the trees above then soars into the sky. 
The forest stretches across rolling hills between streaks of grayish orange clouds. The water catches their reflection in a flame colored.
Words appear - five years
Now, dull gray clouds hang over the same view of the forest, the bay, and the sea. We glide toward the coastline and dive through the trees to the grassy cemetery. A white headstone reads Samuel St. Cloud.
She awkwardly hikes off. SOMEONE gazes after her.
A marine in dress uniform crouches at one of them. SOMEONE strides toward him.
The marine picks at something on the stone, then stands and grins. It's SOMEONE.
SOMEONE picks at bird poop on top of the stone, then studies it on the finger of his white glove.
Elsewhere, SOMEONE carries a crossbow to a tree trunk stump with two arrows. Plopping the weapon on the ground, he quizzically eyes SOMEONE a short distance away. The caretaker stands alone among the headstones, gesturing conversationally and nodding as if talking to someone. SOMEONE keeps his gaze locked on his boss as he uses a pair of pliers to tug a crossbow bolt out of the tree. SOMEONE nods, seemingly to no one.
He beams and strolls off toward the forest. SOMEONE watches tearfully.
SOMEONE steps out of view behind the headstone which reads Timothy Patrick Sullivan, Lieutenant U.S. Marine Corp. Now, SOMEONE strolls into a hobby and toy shop. Three teen girls stand behind the counter.

Now, he strides out of the restaurant, his eyes cast downward. As he steps into the street, a fisherman in waterproof bib pants
slung over his shoulder. Heading toward the harbor, SOMEONE lifts his gaze and stops.
He stares mesmerized out at the water. A beautiful state of the art sloop glides across the harbor. SOMEONE looks away sucking in a breath, then returns his gaze to the sailboat as he sets his bag in the back of his gater.

SOMEONE passes the news crew and strides down the SOMEONE with his eyes fixed on the boat.
Now, the vessel sits anchored with its foresail folded down and tied. The number 11 adorns the side of its sleek hull. SOMEONE squints at SOMEONE as she commands a small crew.
In the glade, SOMEONE flips through a boating magazine to an article with photos of SOMEONE.
He grabs the magazine and runs off.
He reads the article.
He holds the open magazine against his leg and smooth's its wrinkled pages. Night time. At the cemetery, a light above the boat shed's open barn door illuminates the bow of SOMEONE's neglected sailboat inside. In his work area, he sketches at a drafting table. The boating magazine rests above his paper open to pictures and diagrams of SOMEONE's canting keel. He leans back in his chair and glances around absentmindedly with his pencil. 
Later, he rests his head on his hand, his brow furrowed. Lifting his gaze, he strokes his chin thoughtfully and stares at a calendar on the wall. Its monthly picture shows a whale's tail fin curved upward.

Now, SOMEONE cautiously grabs a suspended safety wire running along the side of SOMEONE's sloop. He slides his hand across it as he walks the length of the deck. The vessel's lowered sails rest loosely around the boom, their folds draped over the cabin's roof. SOMEONE sweeps his gaze up at taut vertical line, 
then gives it a light karate chop. Grabbing onto it, he jumps up onto the edge of the deck. He leans back and tugs on the line. He remembers holding a line on his own boat.

SOMEONE blinks, his gaze stricken.
She leaves the cabin with a coy smirk. Turning, SOMEONE plants his hands on the kitchen door frame and leans far back. He straightens, checks his watch, and checks the sunset chart. Pounding it with his fist, he pulls a curtain aside and watches SOMEONE walk away through a warped glass window.

Now, in jeans and a T-shirt, SOMEONE hikes up the waterside path leading to the caretaker's grounds. He breaks into a brief jog, rubbing his eyes.

As she starts for the bus stop, SOMEONE grabs her by the shoulders and presses his lips to hers. Her brow lifts as he kisses her.
Then her shoulders relax and she wraps her arms around him, pulling him close.

As he and his dark-haired colleague exit onto a college campus, a title appears.

In the opposite wing, a paunchy, fair-haired man returns the gesture.
The clean cut man joins him.
SOMEONE gives them an inquiring glance.
The two campaign staffers head backstage where the bearded man pours himself coffee.
SOMEONE eyes SOMEONE.

SOMEONE sits in his car, staring at the bar. Later inside,
SOMEONE regards SOMEONE with a cool, amused gaze.

With a puzzled look, he turns to a bedside table and spots his own phone sitting on top.
He takes off his glasses and rubs his eyes, then wakes SOMEONE.
He hits redial.
With the cell to his ears, SOMEONE's playful expression fades as he listens.

Reaching campaign headquarters, he glances at an idealized poster of SOMEONE in a window, then swings open the door to the bullpen and steps inside.
Sitting behind a desk near the front of the room, SOMEONE glances up at him.
SOMEONE shoots her a brief look as he moves past the desks of the busy staffer.
With his lips set in a troubled line, he enters his office, takes a seat at his desk, and stares out through the windows of the bustling bullpen.
His gaze sweeps from some people examining writing on a whiteboard to the desks of other campaigners making phone calls and typing on laptops.
He stares at the back of SOMEONE's head as she works.
Pushing his chair away from his desk, he gets up and raps his knuckles on a side window which shows SOMEONE working next door.
SOMEONE glances over. Moving from the window, SOMEONE slides off his coat and drops it in a chair.

The staffers in the bullpen pause and look over. He heads back into his office. 
SOMEONE anxiously gets up from her work and follows him.
As SOMEONE enters the office, he continues writing, then shoots the bullpen a cautious look as he hands her the slip of paper.
On SOMEONE' campaign stationary, it reads, "Meet me in the stairwell at noon."
SOMEONE's shoulders rise with a relieved breath.
She returns the note to him and he rips it up.
He avoids her gaze. With a dejected nod, she leaves.
Later, SOMEONE removes his wallet from his coat pocket as he approaches the entrance to the Stock Yards Bank and Trust.
At a counter, he waits as a teller tallies a handful of bills and sets them in front of him.

She continues up the stairs and joins him on the second landing.
SOMEONE gives him a tearful, dejected look.
Now, in SOMEONE's hotel room, SOMEONE gets a text from SOMEONE, "noon tomorrow.‚Äù
He eyes his cellphone. It reads SOMEONE calling.  
SOMEONE pockets the phone and tightens his jaw. 
SOMEONE waits in a car outside a motel with the campaign bus parked nearby. SOMEONE comes out. He watches her approach. 
His gaze softens as it returns to SOMEONE who carries a coat draped over her arm.
She gets in beside him and they share a brief look. Now we peer up at the Roebling Suspension Bridge. SOMEONE drives SOMEONE across.
Leaning back against her headrest, she swallows and lifts her chin, then briefly closes her dark-lashed eyes.
She looks to SOMEONE with a vulnerable pout. He keeps his inscrutable gaze fixed on the road.
SOMEONE turns away sadly and stares ahead.
Later, the car turns onto a city street.
As it pulls into a parking lot, it passes a sign reading, "Oakley Women's Clinic of Cincinnati.‚Äù Now SOMEONE fills out paperwork at a reception desk while SOMEONE waits beside her.
She turns in the forms to a nurse who hands SOMEONE a pink printout.
He folds it in half as the woman speaks to him. Nodding, he replies, "Okay."
He and SOMEONE sit down in the otherwise empty waiting room.
Neither of them looks the other in the eye.
As he faces SOMEONE, she returns a stunned expression. She looks away, her lips trembling.
She glares at SOMEONE with tears in her eyes.

He gets to his feet and paces.
His eyes wide, SOMEONE nods, then looks away.
At the women's clinic, SOMEONE slumps back in a waiting room chair, her hands over her lower abdomen. A nurse hands her a prescription pill bottle.
SOMEONE eyes the label and nods receptively as she listens. The nurse then hands her another bottle of pills.
SOMEONE nods again with a grave frown.
Her eyes drift back and forth from the nurse to the bottles in her slender, graceful hands.
SOMEONE meets the woman's gaze with wide eyes and gives a final nod.
As the nurse steps away, the young abortion patient briefly musters a smile for her. Now, SOMEONE loosens his tie and sighs tensely as he drives down a city street.
At the clinic, a lamp softly illuminates the dusky waiting room as SOMEONE clutches her medicine in a bag between her knees. She shifts pensively in her chair.
On the road, SOMEONE stares ahead with a sullen gaze.
Outside the clinic, SOMEONE clutches her coat around her as she leaves on foot.
She glances at traffic on the road beside her, and then approaches a cafe.
Later, she sits inside in a booth by a window.
As the sky grows darker outside, she peers out in the clinic's direction, then checks her watch.
Lifting her gaze, she stares off grimly.
As SOMEONE drives on, we glimpse the sunset outside.
At night, he finally arrives outside the clinic.
Finding it closed, he drives on.
Outside her motel, SOMEONE exits a taxicab.
She lets SOMEONE into her room.
SOMEONE's eyes glisten.
Her jaw drops open in a horrified expression.
Leaning forward, she brings a hand to her mouth and shifts her hopeless, tearful gaze.
Now SOMEONE marches purposefully down a sidewalk, his jaw set tight.
He arrives at a storefront with a banner over the entrance reading, "Pullman for President", and goes in.
He holds his wrathful gaze fixed straight ahead.
At the far end of the campaign headquarters, SOMEONE meets with colleagues in a dimly lit office.
He spots SOMEONE and gives a grim smirk.
Later, they enter another small office together.
SOMEONE glances back at the departing staffer, and then faces SOMEONE.
SOMEONE steps in closer, his face half-obscured in shadow. He gives a nod.
SOMEONE abruptly turns away and leaves the room.
SOMEONE lingers, gazing after him with gleaming eyes.
Now we view him from behind as he drives. With a slow, steady rhythm, his wiper sweep rain from his windshield as the city lights twinkle outside.
Later at SOMEONE's motel, he exits the car.
Indoors, we peer down through a narrow gap at a stairwell banister and glimpsed SOMEONE climbing up.
Arriving in a hallway, he spots a man using a walkie-talkie as he hurries from a room.
SOMEONE continues coolly down the hall.
Arriving at the door to SOMEONE's room, he tenses as he finds it ajar.
He gives it a knock, then pushes it open.
A shadowy figure sits on the bed with his back to us.
SOMEONE makes his way over with a furrowed brow.
He halts and stares down with glistening eyes. Her face out of view behind the bed, SOMEONE lies motionless on the floor, her legs and left arm splayed awkwardly.
Fighting tears, Stephens steps a little closer.
Holding the room's phone to his ear, the man on the bed regards him sympathetically.
SOMEONE sees the pill bottles on a bedside table.
SOMEONE notices SOMEONE's cell peeking out from under her coat on the bed. With his back turned to him, the man on the bed sits in silhouette against the room's soft lamp light.
Later, SOMEONE steps back out into the rainy night.
Moving with a stiff gait, he marches across the parking lot to his car. As he gets in, rain patters heavily against his windshield.
The wipers move in a slow rhythm against the downpour.
The water cast modeled shadows against SOMEONE's face as he steers off forlornly.
He sets SOMEONE's phone down, and takes out his own, and scrolls through the menu to check his messages.
His eyes welled with tears.
The next day at campaign headquarters, SOMEONE and the others watch a news report.
Now, as a figure sits on a bench facing the Ohio River,
SOMEONE's lanky frame steps into view.
He walks up to the bench and takes a seat.
Both men stare out over the river's slate gray water towards Cincinnati on the other side.
As traffic moves across the nearby Roebling Bridge, Senator SOMEONE narrows his eyes and wets his lips.
SOMEONE regards him with a sober frown and nods.
SOMEONE faces him with a furrowed brow and glances warily past his shoulder.
The young man stares at the senator through narrowed eyes, his lips pressed tightly shut.
SOMEONE reaches out hesitantly, then gives his leg a brisk pat and leaves.
Now at a press conference, Paul, Ben, and the other staffers flank SOMEONE as he gives a statement.
He looks to SOMEONE and moves up to the podium. SOMEONE steps aside and checks his cell.
The phone display reads, "Molly calling.‚Äù

He finds SOMEONE holding SOMEONE's cellphone to his ear.
A flashbulb pops on the governor's wide-eyed stare.
SOMEONE lowers the phone with a cold expression.
SOMEONE clenches his jaw.
Nighttime. Seen from behind, SOMEONE leads us down a sidewalk, following the wall of a shadowy brick building.
Two black SUVs wait outside the closed establishment.
SOMEONE stops and peers in through a window with open blinds on the inside.
He enters a front vestibule and steps into the dim establishment.
As he peers across the room, all but the lower quadrant of his face remains cast in shadow.
At the end of a long empty bar, a man stands in silhouette in the dark.
SOMEONE crosses the darkened room, passing a dozen unoccupied barstools.
He steps past the motionless Secret Service agent and heads through an illuminated doorway to a kitchen.
He crosses a well-lit section on his way to another darkened area.
Beyond stock shelves on a center counter, light shine under an industrial range hood.
SOMEONE shifts his gaze.
He ambles around the counter and finds the governor.
SOMEONE turns away.
He abruptly returns his gaze to the former staffer and the two maintain eye contact.
Shadow conceals all but a lower quarter of the governor's face.
SOMEONE draws a tense breath. SOMEONE remains still.
SOMEONE steps from the shadows, his right eye becoming glaringly visible in the dim light.
SOMEONE swallows his smirk. His expression hardens.
SOMEONE remains poker-faced.
SOMEONE maintains eye contact with SOMEONE who glowers and swallows.
In a barbershop, a seated a bibbed SOMEONE gets a haircut by a barber standing behind him.
Our view slowly roves around the side of the paunchy, middle-aged campaign manager
who gazes flatly from under his wrinkled brow.
Later, SOMEONE steps outside wearing his thick-rimmed glasses.
Beyond him, a black SUV idles just footsteps away.
Poking out of a nearby alley, another sits parked by the curb.
The campaign manager lights a cigarette then notices the SUV.
Taking a few drags, he heads down the sidewalk and approaches the vehicle in the alleyway.
A backseat window rolls down revealing SOMEONE inside.
The tinted window rolls up and SOMEONE manages a final pull on his cigarette.
He stubs it out on a wall and climbs into the SUV.
A head-on view of the black car gradually drifts toward the grill.
Its front tires rest in a buildup of icy gray slush on the alley apron.
To the left, exhaust blooms from the tailpipe of the second SUV.
The view keeps inching toward the nose of SOMEONE' vehicle until most of the second SUV falls out of view.
The forward moving trip ceases halfway across the street.
The backdoor opens.
SOMEONE steps out and shuts it behind him.
The SUV pulls out of the alley and drives off, followed by its twin.
With his hands in his coat pockets, SOMEONE peers after them.
He shifts his wry and resigned gaze.
Now on a hotel room, SOMEONE watches TV while shaving.
Now, a hearse and three black cars wait outside a cathedral.
Inside, a dark wood coffin topped by an arrangement of white flowers lies at the front of a packed sanctuary.
SOMEONE Stearns stands at a podium.
The bereaved father swallows, then glances upward.
Among the attendees, SOMEONE looks at SOMEONE who sits across the aisle a few rows up.

Later as SOMEONE exit the cathedral, SOMEONE smokes a cigarette as he ambles across a wintry lawn of dead grass.
He approaches SOMEONE.
He heads off.
SOMEONE gets into his car. Now, SOMEONE stands at a podium with SOMEONE and his wife beside him.
The crowd of excited supporters wave American flags and hold signs. SOMEONE stands motionless toward the back.

SOMEONE nods.
SOMEONE gazes absently.
Now, the new campaign manager leads the way down a hall into a room marked "Morris Event Staff Only.‚Äù

The brunette intern faces SOMEONE. Outside, SOMEONE marches across a walkway and heads up the front steps of the campus building.
Later, he heads down an empty stairwell.
SOMEONE waits in a corridor. She follows SOMEONE down the hall toward a pair of imposing guards.
He dons his ID.
They share a knowing gaze, then SOMEONE files past one of the security guards.
Walking in our direction, he crosses a darkened corridor, his face cast in shadow.
An overhead light briefly reveals the young campaign manager's emotionless gaze.
As he continues his stride, another overhead offers a second glimpse of his plain look.
In a dim gymnasium, an empty canvass and wood director's chair awaits.
Beyond it, the lone campaign manager emerges as a blurry form from the corridor.
SOMEONE arrives at the makeshift set and takes a seat under a spotlight, illuminating a patch of the otherwise darkened gym floor.
A soundman outfits him with an earpiece while a makeup artist touches up his face.
The makeup artist leaves. As the soundman preps him for the interview, our view gradually orbits around the side of SOMEONE's face.
SOMEONE nods, gazing straight ahead with a deadpan expression.
As our view finally settles facing the young campaign manager, SOMEONE looks to his left.
He notices the blonde-haired makeup artist admiring him, then faces the camera and lowers his gaze.
We gradually press in on the campaign manager's handsome face, his eyes downcast.
SOMEONE looks directly at us.

The key sticks in the gate's lock.
He tries ramming the gate with his shoulder as his associates listen.
Trying to climb the wood plank fence, SOMEONE steps on a garden gnome posted at the gate. As he scans the garden, the ceramic sculpture shatters under his weight.

In slow motion, we watch the beats of its tiny wings. As it flies off, SOMEONE beams after it and his tally ticks up to 158.

He angrily ends the call. Our view contracts around an owl in a nearby tapestry.
It comes to life and flies at us.
At the wheel of a car, SOMEONE wakes to find himself in the path of an 18-wheeler.
He wrenches the wheel, waking his companion.
Narrowly avoiding the truck, the car skids off the road and slams sideways into a tree.
Leaving the mustached birder in the passenger seat, SOMEONE lowers his window, then climbs out of the car through it.
He faces the tree, grimly inspecting the damage to the car's back door.
SOMEONE turns wide-eyed.
The champion birder ventures into the thick evergreen forest. In the passenger seat,
the mustached birder keeps one arm at his side as he starts to turn in his seat.
He winces and unbuckles his seat belt, then reaches into the back.
He comes out following SOMEONE.
The champion looks up. Green leafy branches form a canopy overhead, but give no sign of a bird. He treks further into the woods. Shifting his searching gaze, SOMEONE moves a branch aside, then halts at the side of a black and white woodpecker.
